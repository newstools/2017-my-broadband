If Sanral fails as a result of the e-toll boycott, the country’s economy will be in a worse position. This is according to Vusi Mona, general manager of communications at Sanral. He said it is concerning that organisations like Outa appear to relish in the current situation that Sanral finds itself in. Despite Outa’s efforts, the courts have found that the e-toll project was implemented legally, said Mona. “Sanral is confident that the current matters before the courts will find this to be the case. Road users follow Outa’s advice at their peril.” Mona said the road infrastructure maintained by Sanral carries the bulk of freight traffic in the country, and services its citizens. If Sanral fails, the economy will become worse. The expansion and improvement of the highways in Gauteng provided several benefits, said Mona: “For the last four years, commuters in Gauteng have reaped the benefits of the project,” said Mona. “While we may continue to disagree on many things surrounding the project, I think we can all agree that it has already helped to improve the lives of Gauteng citizens.” Mona warned most of the upgraded freeways will reach their capacity within the next 3 to 5 years, and that more phases of the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project must be executed. “With insufficient funding, phases two and three are unlikely to be implemented.”
