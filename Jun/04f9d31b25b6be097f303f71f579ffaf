Rain – formerly Wireless Business Solutions (WBS) – was recently launched, and promises to provide South Africans with increased connectivity at affordable prices. Rain has rolled out 750 LTE-A sites to date, and is on track to meet a target of 2,000 sites by the end of 2017. The company said its LTE-Advanced data network will provide “open access” to the Internet for everyone – operators, resellers, and consumers. Michael Jordaan, director and shareholder of Rain, said their objective is to establish a cutting-edge LTE-A fixed and mobile network, designed to meet growing consumer demand. Jordaan told MyBroadband that they will provide simple, easy, and transparent access to data. “Our aim is to deliver the best possible quality and speeds at affordable rates. For example, Rain data will not expire and there will be no out-of-bundle penalties,” said Jordaan. Rain is a “mobile data first” offering that changes the perception of data from “a bolt-on to a voice offering” to a primary requirement. “We believe that in the foreseeable future, all voice calls will be carried over data networks, through WhatsApp, VoIP, and VoLTE,” said Jordaan. Rain’s first commercial product will be a fixed-wireless broadband service called “Rain to the Home”, which will launch soon. The company will offer full mobile services in the future, but this will only happen when the company has sufficient coverage. Jordaan said Rain’s market strategy, including how to purchase the service and potential launch partners, will be announced soon.
