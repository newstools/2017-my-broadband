Blue Label and The Prepaid Company, a subsidiary of Blue Label, has concluded an agreement with 3G Mobile to acquire 100% of 3G’s issued share capital for R1.9 billion. “The shares in 3G Mobile will be acquired in two stages, with the initial acquisition of 47.37% of the issued share capital of 3G for a purchase consideration of R900 million,” said Blue Label. 3G Mobile is one of Africa’s largest distributors, and financiers, of mobile devices and handsets to major retailers and cellular network providers, said the company. It operates in eight African countries, including South Africa. “It has distribution rights for all major tier one and tier two mobile device and handset manufacturers, including Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Hisense, ZTE, and Nokia.” Blue Label said 3G Mobile will be used as an expansion platform into the financing and supply of mobile devices. “Both of these functions supplement Blue Label’s strategic objectives to provide value added services to both Cell C and its customer base.”
