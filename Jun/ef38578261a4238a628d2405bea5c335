Wink has unveiled its Home Sitter and Moonlight services, which work with its Wink Bright kit. The Wink Bright smart lighting kit includes one Wink Hub 2 and two Sylvania Smart A19 Dimmable light bulbs. Lights are often used as a deterrent against criminals to make it look like someone is at home, and for outdoor security to ward off intruders or animals. With this in mind, Wink has created Home Sitter and Moonlight using its smart lighting technology. Home Sitter makes it look like someone is home when you’re away by turning the lights on and off in a way that mimics natural, human patterns. Moonlight ensures a well-lit home by turning the smart lights on and off at predetermined times – sunrise and sunset by default. Wink Bright has a recommended retail price of $119, and is available for preorder.
