Google Chrome will come with an ad filter from early 2018, which will filter advertisements that do not comply with Better Ads Standards. “It’s far too common that people encounter annoying, intrusive ads on the web – like the kind that blare music unexpectedly, or force you to wait 10 seconds before you can see content,” said Google. “These frustrating experiences can lead some people to block all ads, taking a big toll on the content creators who depend on ads to fund their content creation.” Google said it joined the Coalition for Better Ads because it believes online ads should be better. Google has also launched a tool that lets website owners identify “annoying ad experiences”, and is also testing a system called Funding Choices. This lets publishers show a custom message to visitors who use an ad blocker, inviting them to enable ads or pay for a pass that removes all ads. “We believe these changes will ensure all content creators can continue to have a sustainable way to fund their work with online advertising.”
