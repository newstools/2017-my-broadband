A study by the University of Connecticut shows that the use of e-cigarettes may be just as harmful as smoking tobacco cigarettes. Researchers developed a low-cost, 3D printed testing device to detect DNA damage from metabolites of chemicals in environmental samples. The e-cigarettes, which typically make use of nicotine-based liquids, were found to cause significant DNA damage – a leading cause of cancer. “From the results of our study, we can conclude that e-cigarettes have as much potential to cause DNA damage as unfiltered regular cigarettes,” said the researchers. The amount of DNA damage caused by vaping depends on how much vapour is inhaled, what other additives are used, and whether nicotine or non-nicotine liquid is used.
