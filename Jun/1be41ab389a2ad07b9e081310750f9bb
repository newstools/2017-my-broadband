Hyundai has unveiled its first mass-produced electric bus, the Elec City. The Elec City can travel 290km on a single charge and can be fully recharged in 67 minutes. The bus uses a 256kW lithium-ion polymer battery and features numerous safety utilities, such as Around View Monitoring and Full Colour Digital Cluster. “Hyundai has achieved a lot in the eco-friendly vehicle field, but we will never stand still,” said the company. “We continue to invest heavily to ensure zero-emission technology for all commercial vehicles.” Hyundai plans to launch the Elec City bus in 2018.
