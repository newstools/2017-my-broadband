Google has launched Tensor2Tensor, a library that will help researchers train deep learning models for use in its TensorFlow framework. “T2T facilitates the creation of state-of-the art models for a variety of ML applications, such as translation, parsing, image captioning, and more,” said Google. “This release also includes a library of datasets and models, including the best models from a few recent papers to help kick-start your own DL research.” Models available include: The following results of a standard WMT English-German translation task using previous state-of-the-art models, compared to Tensor2Tensor, were provided by Google. Its Transformer and SliceNet outperformed GNMT and GNMT+MOE.
