DEOD has secured the near-live short-form digital rights for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 and the ICC Women’s World Cup 2017. DEOD has also been appointed as the exclusive aggregator in sub-Saharan Africa by the Channel 2 Group for all ICC tournaments, up to and including the 2019 ICC World Cup. Channel 2 Group is the digital rights licensor in the region and holds the global audio rights for the ICC until the 2023 World Cup. The deal will allow DEOD to show near-live highlights of the events to South African viewers, said Tim Cook, the senior manager for sports at Discover Digital. Cook said they have created a cricket package to cover both tournaments, priced at R10, so viewers won’t have to subscribe to DEOD’s Premium Package. The content will also be available to Sports OnDemand and DEOD Premium customers.
