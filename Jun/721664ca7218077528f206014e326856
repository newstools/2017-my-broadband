Users can now download the public beta version of iOS 11 from Apple’s website. The operating system was unveiled at WWDC 2017 and includes various application improvements – such as the ability to easily transfer media between apps, and new features. After signing up for the Apple Beta Software Program, users can enroll their device to access the beta of iOS 11. The beta version is expected to include bugs, and users can provide feedback on issues using Apple’s Feedback Assistant app. The final release of iOS 11 is expected to be available later this year.
