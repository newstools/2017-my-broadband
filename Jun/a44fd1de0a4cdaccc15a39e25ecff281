The European Union has imposed a record $2.7bn fine on technology giant Google, for abusing its dominance as a search engine by giving illegal advantage to its own shopping service. “What Google has done is illegal under EU antitrust rules. It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate,” Margrethe Vestager, the European commissioner for competition, said in a statement. “And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services and the full benefits of innovation.” Brussels has demanded that the US tech giant change the business model for Google Shopping to meet the EU’s concerns. Google said it “respectfully” disagreed with the ruling. “We will review the (European) Commission’s decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,” Kent Walker, the company’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. The fine broke the previous EU record for a monopoly case against US chipmaker Intel of €1.06bn. Al Jazeera
