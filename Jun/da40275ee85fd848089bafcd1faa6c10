Cell C has launched a new set of contract packages called Connector, offering voice minutes, SMS messages, and data. The packages range from Connector 1 – which has 1,000 minutes and SMS messages, and 3GB of data – up to Connector 5. They also include free access to Facebook, with a fair use limit of 1GB per month. Voice minutes are valid for calls to any local network, and plans taken out before 30 June will receive double the normal data allocation. The double data promotion will give you free data every month for the duration of your Connector contract. A month-to-month Connector plan will therefore only receive double the data during the first month. Cell C’s new Connector plans are only available online through Cell C’s website. The details of the packages are below.
