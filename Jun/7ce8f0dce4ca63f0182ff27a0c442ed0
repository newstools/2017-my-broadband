Cell C recently launched its Connector deals, which offer voice minutes, SMS messages, and data. The packages range from Connector 1 – which has 1,000 minutes and SMS messages, and 3GB of data – up to Connector 5. They also include free access to Facebook, with a fair use limit of 1GB per month. Cell C’s new deals compete against Telkom’s FreeMe packages, which are sold as “data-first” offerings. FreeMe deals also include high allocations of data, along with free SMS and voice minutes, and value-added services. We took Cell C’s Connector plans and compared them against Telkom’s FreeMe offerings – as shown in the table below. It must be noted that Connector plans taken out before 30 June will receive double the normal data allocation. The double data promotion will give you free data every month for the duration of your Connector contract.
