Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube have formed the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism. “We believe that by working together, sharing the best technological and operational elements of our individual efforts, we can have a greater impact on the threat of terrorist content online,” said the group. The companies will formalise and structure existing and future areas of collaboration, and foster cooperation with smaller tech companies, civil society groups and academics, and governments. Initially the work will focus on technology solutions, research, and knowledge sharing. “We will be hosting a series of learning workshops in partnership with UN CTED/ICT4Peace in Silicon Valley and around the world to drive these areas of collaboration.”
