SuperSport has introduced a new channel line-up to give sport lovers “a better viewing experience”. The company said DStv customers can look forward to 14 SuperSport and one eSports channel – with “less duplication of sports across channels and more predictable scheduling”. “DStv customers on all packages will find a rebranded SuperSport Select, now on SS10, and DStv Extra customers will get more sports channels: SS7 and SS8.” La Liga is now on SS7 exclusively, while SS11 (new channel) and SS12 will become permanent events channels for overflow sport. GINX eSports TV, currently available on DStv Now, will be shown on DStv channel 240. Premium, Extra, and Compact customers will have access to the channel. SS Blitz, SS1 to SS9, and SS11 will be in HD, said the company. GINX eSports TV will also be in HD, while SS8 – currently in SD – will change to HD. The new channel line-up will take effect on 4 July. “Sport fans will start their viewing on Channel 200 on SuperSport Blitz through to SuperSport 12.”
