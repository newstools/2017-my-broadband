Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht will spend the rest of his life in jail after he lost his latest legal appeal. Silk Road was an online market and the first modern darknet market, known as a platform for selling illegal drugs. Silk Road was operated as a Tor service, and users were able to browse it anonymously and securely without traffic monitoring. The FBI shut down Silk Road in October 2013 and arrested Ulbricht for his role as founder “Dread Pirate Roberts”. In February 2015, a jury convicted Ulbricht of seven charges, including engaging in a criminal enterprise, narcotics trafficking, and money laundering. Ulbricht was given life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He appealed the sentence and the guilty verdict, but his appeal failed.
