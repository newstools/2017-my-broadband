Unfortunately, with Ransomware, once your files are infected, there is not much you can do to reverse this besides paying up – which often isn’t effective anyway. The reality of ransomware is that it damages or destroys computer files, causing loss of business for organisations whilst compromising their information systems. For this reason, users should employ certain measures to ensure a higher level of defence against these plagues. As in many cases, with Ransomware, prevention is always better than cure. So, with that in mind, you will need to know what steps can you take to avoid becoming a ransomware victim.
