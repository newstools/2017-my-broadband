The maintenance and roll-out of Tshwane’s free Wi-Fi project, TshWi-Fi, will be put out to tender. This means it is not guaranteed that current contractor Project Isizwe will continue to supply the city’s Wi-Fi services. “After months of negotiation with Project Isizwe, the City believes we can take the first important step to secure the future of Tshwane free Wi-Fi,” said member of the mayoral committee for corporate and shared services, Cilliers Brink. News of the tender process comes after the Auditor General red-flagged the R180 million spent on Tshwane’s free Wi-Fi network as “unlawful and irregular expenditure”. Brink said the solution will need to be approved by the City Council at its June meeting, but as it stands it can be summarised as follows: “We acknowledge that although its means of procurement may have been left wanting, the City did receive substantial benefit from its investment in free Wi-Fi,” said Brink. Brink said that with the short-term future of free Wi-Fi secured, the ingenuity of the private sector now becomes crucial to securing the service in the long-term. “It is simply not possible for the City to sustain its full subsidy of free Wi-Fi indefinitely, or to fund the expansion of the network on its own.” Commercial investment and partnerships are needed, he said.
