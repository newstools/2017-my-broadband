Google said it now has neural translation support for Zulu and Xhosa. The development will allow translations to be closer to spoken language, it said. Blaise Aguera y Arcas, who heads up a machine intelligence division at Google, said previous translations were based on programming an understanding of the grammar of a language into the translator. With neural translation, the service learns the language from hundreds of thousands of examples and builds a “concept space” – an intermediary language the software uses to translate phrases from one language to another. Neural translation for Zulu, Xhosa, and Swahili is available on Google Translate.
