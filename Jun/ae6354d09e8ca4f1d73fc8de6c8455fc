Showmax has unveiled its first original production, Tali’s Wedding Diary. The show is a “mockumentary” featuring Julia Anastasopoulos, who stars as Tali, a self-obsessed Sandton princess who’s moved to Cape Town and has hired a documentary crew to film the build-up to her wedding. The actress is best known for her SuzelleDIY channel on YouTube. The director of Tali’s Wedding Diary is Ari Kruger, who has worked as a director for commercials, music videos, and online content. Showmax is also working on iNumber Number, an original crime drama series in coproduction with Mzansi Magic. Filming for Tali’s Wedding Diary is currently underway in Cape Town, and the eight-part series will premiere on Showmax in December. Each episode of the series will be approximately 20 minutes long.
