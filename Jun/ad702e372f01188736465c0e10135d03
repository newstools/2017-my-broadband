Wireless Business Solutions and its LTE-A network have been rebranded as Rain, which promises to provide consumers with increased connectivity at affordable prices. Rain has so far rolled out 750 LTE-A sites, and is on track to meet a target of 2,000 sites by the end of the year. “Our coverage is increasing daily. Very shortly, we will be announcing details of a fixed-wireless broadband service, Rain to the Home (RttH) as a fibre or DSL alternative,” said Rain CEO Duncan Simpson-Craib. “It will be delivered on what we call fibre-to-the-sky using our state-of-the art LTE-A network. In future, we will be launching a full mobile data service.” Rain’s chairman Paul Harris said the mobile broadband industry is “undersupplied and we want to step into the breach”. Michael Jordaan, director and shareholder of Rain, said their objective is to establish a cutting-edge LTE-A fixed and mobile network, designed to meet growing consumer demand. “Rain will provide simple, easy, and transparent access to data, connecting the people of South Africa to the limitless possibilities of the digital world,” said Jordaan. “The aim is to eventually create an environment where open access to the Internet becomes a reality in this country, with the best possible quality and speeds we can deliver, at affordable rates for all.” MyBroadband’s Speed Test App has shown that download speeds on the network ranged between 46Mbps and 96Mbps, with an average performance of 65Mbps. Details about the company, including its coverage map, are available on the Rain website.
