Google is pulling the plug on Google Talk (Gchat), the XMPP-based messaging service it launched in 2005, The Verge reported. Google has tried to migrate Talk users to Hangouts, killing the Google Talk client for Windows in 2015, and announcing in March that holdouts would be forcibly moved from this week. Third-party XMPP clients will continue to work with Hangouts for 1-on-1 chats. However, XMPP federation with third-party services will no longer be supported from today. Those using Talk in Gmail will be moved to Hangouts. There is a Dense Roster setting in Hangouts that provides a similar experience, said Google. Google said Hangouts offers several improvements over Google Talk, such as group video calling and integration with other Google products. “With the introduction of Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat, it is now time to say goodbye to Google Talk.”
