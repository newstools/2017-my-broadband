Telkom recently released its annual results for the year ended 31 March 2017, which showed a 38.4% increase in mobile service revenue – now standing at R3.50 billion. Active mobile subscribers were up 47.7% to 3.999 million, comprised of 2.772 million prepaid users and 1.227 million post-paid users. The prepaid and postpaid segments saw growth of 44.9% and 54.5% respectively over the past year. These are exceptional numbers in a saturated mobile market, and according to Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko, it is thanks to four growth drivers. Maseko added that they are seeing prepaid and postpaid users from other networks migrate to Telkom, because they have a “slightly better data network”.
