Climeworks has unveiled its first commercial carbon dioxide capture plant, which absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere and purifies it for distribution to various industries. The company uses a special material which captures CO2 on its surface once it is in contact with ambient air. Climeworksâ€™ plant consists of three stacked shipping containers that hold six carbon dioxide collectors each. The technology used is around 1,000 times more effective than plant photosynthesis, and the company said this approach holds great promise for meeting global warming goals. The carbon capture plant is located next to a greenhouse, which it will supply with 900 tons of purified CO2 per year. It uses the heat and electricity supplied by a neighbouring waste treatment plant to power its equipment. The CO2 captured by Climeworks can be used to carbonate beverages or produce climate-neutral fuels and other materials.
