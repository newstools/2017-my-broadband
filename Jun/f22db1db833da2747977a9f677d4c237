The United States now asks for your social media accounts during visa applications. In the Social Media section of the visa application form, users must detail the platforms they use and their unique handles. “Please provide your unique user name for any websites or applications you have used to create or share content (photos, videos, status updates, etc.) as part of a public profile within the last five years,” states the form. The new questions form part of the vetting process for visitors to the US, which was approved by the US Office of Management and Budget last month. Reuters reported that critics argue the “new questions would be overly burdensome, lead to long delays in processing, and discourage international students and scientists from coming to the United States”.
