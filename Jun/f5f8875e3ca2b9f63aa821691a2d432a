Following the resurgence of the #DataMustFall campaign, Twitter users are calling for a social media blackout on Wednesday. The call was picked up by musician Ntsiki Mazwai, EWN reported. Mazwai also championed the renewed #DataMustFall campaign yesterday. #DataMustFall’s return came after MTN cancelled its free unlimited Twitter service. “Due to abuse of the free service, we have had to cap usage to 100MB per day,” said MTN. The cap was subsequently raised to 500MB. Once you hit the cap, you are charged normal data rates. The “social media blackout” campaign is calling on South Africans to stay off platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Mazwai said that #SocialMediaBlackout is also asking people not to buy mobile data bundles for one day. The protest is about lowering data prices and about data expiry, said Mazwai. When followers asked how they can support the cause without compromising their need to access the Internet, Mazwai said: “Plan ahead… work around it… let’s just let them feel the pinch for one day.”
