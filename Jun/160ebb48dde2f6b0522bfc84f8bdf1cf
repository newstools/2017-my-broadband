Online stores in South Africa have listed pricing for Intel’s new Core X processors. Intel’s new processors are based on the Skylake-X and Kaby Lake-X high-end CPU architectures, and are compatible with the new LGA 2066 socket on Intel’s X299 chipset. The power consumption of the new processors is significantly higher than the current 7th-gen desktop chips, with the Core i9-7900X featuring a TDP of 140W. The 4,6,8, and 10-core CPUs listed on Evetech and Rebel Tech are “Coming Soon”, and are set to release internationally on 26 June 2017. More powerful versions of the Core X processors will be available later this year, including the Intel Core i9-7980XE Extreme Edition.
