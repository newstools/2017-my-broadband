HP has revealed its latest line of Omen gaming hardware, which includes new laptops and desktops. Heading up the range are the new Omen 15 and refreshed Omen 17 gaming laptops.  The Omen laptops will start at $999 and feature either Nvidia or AMD Radeon graphics cards. The 17-inch model comes with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 or AMD Radeon RX 580, while the 15-inch model is capped at a GTX 1060 or RX 550. Processing is taken care of by the latest Intel Core processors, storage options include PCIe SSDs or a dual-storage set-up, while the RAM limit is set at 32GB DDR4 . The Omen 15 features a 15.6-inch display – available in 1080p or 4K – while the Omen 17 sports a 17.3-inch screen with the same resolution options. HP’s laptops also feature Bang & Olufsen speakers, USB 3.1 and USB Type-C Thunderbolt ports, and HDMI and DisplayPort connections.  The Omen Desktop is aimed at high-end gamers who want to run the latest titles in high settings at fast frame rates. Graphics options for the Omen Desktop include either an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 580. Customers also have a choice between an Intel Core processor or an AMD Ryzen CPU, while all units will receive a maximum of 32GB DDR4 RAM. HP said the Omen case can handle a “massive” amount of storage, and provides support for four 3.5″ HDD bays, two optional 3.5″ bays at the top of the case, and PCIe SSDs. The chassis features tool-less access, multiple USB Type-A and Type-C ports, and two 120mm fans – with an option for liquid cooling.  The final piece of the new Omen PC gaming line-up was the HP Omen Accelerator. The $300 external GPU case allows users to insert a single desktop graphics card – along with a 2.5″ hard drive – into the device and hook it up to a gaming laptop. The Accelerator features USB Type-C and Type-A connectivity, along with HDMI and Ethernet ports. The device will support Omen laptops, along with other devices from HP, via a Thunderbolt 3 connection.
