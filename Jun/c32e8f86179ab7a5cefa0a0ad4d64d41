Vodacom has opened a Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) laboratory at Vodaworld, which aims to commercialise IoT systems using narrowband networking. The company’s NB-IoT network is set to launch commercially in major cities across South Africa later this year. “Vodacom’s NB-IoT lab provides a controlled test environment and framework for customers and developers to develop hardware and applications as well as test their end point devices on the NB-IoT network,” said Managing Executive for Vodacom IoT Deon Liebenberg. This follows Vodacom’s recent launch of Africa’s first live NB-IoT site in partnership with Huawei. The Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) devices used by the network are power efficient and have multi-year batteries. The NB-IoT network will leverage Vodacom’s existing network infrastructure, which the company said would ensure excellent coverage.
