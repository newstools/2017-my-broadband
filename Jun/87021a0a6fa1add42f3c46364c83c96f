Google has announced improvements to its Android Security Rewards programme, with increased rewards for successful attacks. “Because every Android release includes more security protections and no researcher has claimed the top reward for an exploit chain in two years, we’re excited to increase our top-line payouts for these exploits,” said Google. “In addition to rewarding for vulnerabilities, we continue to work with the broad and diverse Android ecosystem to protect users from issues reported through our programme.”
