TheDarkOverlord (TDO) has leaked eight episodes of ABC’s upcoming show “Steve Harvey’s Funderdome” after the network refused to discuss ransom terms, TorrentFreak reported. This is the same hacking group which posted episodes from the new season of Orange is the New Black on The Pirate Bay when Netflix refused to pay a ransom. “We approached ABC with a most handsome business proposal, but we were so rudely denied an audience. Therefore, we decided to bestow a gift upon the good people of the Internet,” TDO told TorrentFreak. It speculated that TDO got the show during a breach at post-production company Larson Studios, which is where the hacking group reportedly obtained the Orange is the New Black episodes. TDO said it has more content from Netflix, National Geographic, Fox, and IFC, and will leak them online unless their future demands are met.
