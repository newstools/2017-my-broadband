Wireless Business Solutions has launched its LTE-A network under the name Rain. Rain promises to provide consumers with increased connectivity at affordable prices, and has rolled out 750 LTE-A sites to date. It is on track to meet a target of 2,000 sites by the end of the year, and said its coverage is increasing daily. “Very shortly, we will be announcing details of a fixed-wireless broadband service, Rain to the Home (RttH) as a fibre or DSL alternative,” said Rain CEO Duncan Simpson-Craib. The company said it is rolling out Rain on a daily basis to more areas in South Africa, as shown in its coverage map. Citizens who are not covered can send Rain an email with a request for their area to be included, using “coverage@rain.co.za”.
