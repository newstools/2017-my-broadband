Logitech has launched a pair of new wireless mice, the MX Master 2S and MX Anywhere 2S. The devices are compatible with the manufacturer’s new Logitech Flow software, which allows users to control up to three computers at once with a single mouse. The Flow software also allows users to copy and paste content between different desktops, and is available for free as part of the Logitech Options software suite. Both the Master 2S and Anywhere 2S feature Darkfield high-precision tracking with a DPI of 4,000. The mice are able to track on any surface, including glass, and feature rechargeable batteries which can last up to 70 days. Both mice include a speed-adaptive scroll wheel which shifts dynamically. The MX Master 2S also features a thumb wheel for side-to-side scrolling. Logitech’s new mice are expected to launch in South Africa in Q3 2017.
