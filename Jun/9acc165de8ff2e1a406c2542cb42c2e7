Amazon has launched Twitch Prime, a premium subscription service for its video game streaming platform. “To celebrate this launch, starting June 9, Twitch Prime members around the globe will have access to exclusive Twitch-themed apparel in one of the most watched games on Twitch: PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS,” the company said. “As a Twitch Prime member, you get access to monthly free games, loot, and a host of other perks like ad-free Twitch viewing, custom emotes, special chat badges, and a free monthly channel subscription to give out to your favorite streamers.” Users can access Twitch Prime as part of their Amazon Prime Video subscription. In South Africa, Prime Video – with Twitch Prime – is available for an introductory price of $2.99 per month for the first six months, and $5.99 thereafter. A free 7-day trial is also available, but there is no free Twitch channel subscription during the trial. Prime Video members receive access to the free Twitch channel subscription once their paid membership begins.
