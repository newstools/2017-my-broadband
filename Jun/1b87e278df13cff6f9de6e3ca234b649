Aria Technologies Africa (ATA) is inviting Reseller and Service Provider Partners to join ATA in a journey “Connect Sub Sahara Africa”. The aim of the journey is to distribute, install and maintain ICT solutions across the Sub Saharan African market. ATA is entrenched in the ICT landscape as a cutting-edge Solutions and Service Provider to customers in both South Africa and across Sub Saharan Africa. As an African based company, ATA is well positioned in the increasingly competitive ICT market, not only as a Distributor of innovative Voice and Data solutions, but also with the capacity to deliver specialized pre- and after-sales service. ATA further complements this with ongoing product evolution and innovation with exclusive OEM Partners, ensuring they meet the continually changing needs of customers across the Sub Saharan African market. ATA’s philosophy is simple: Limit distribution to ‘Best-in-Class’ with the most appropriate solution and services for the customer, backed by highly skilled professional resources. “We see things not as they are but as they could be. We dream of the future, of something bigger and better, for us as a South African company,” says ATA. The aim of this EOI is not only to expand the Exclusive ATA Reseller Partner family but also to engage Service Providers to execute the installation and commissioning of the various ICT solutions offered by ATA across the Sub Saharan African market. All potential Resellers and Service Provider Partners that are interested to join ATA’s journey as they embark to ‘Connect Sub Sahara Africa’ are invited to respond to this EOI by clicking here.
