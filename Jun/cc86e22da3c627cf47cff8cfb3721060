MWEB and Webafrica have confirmed they will offer LTE-A services using the Rain network. This follows news from Internet Solutions that it will act as Rain’s open access go-to-market partner for its fixed LTE-A product. Wireless Business Solutions, which operated the iBurst network, rebranded as Rain last week and announced it had rolled out 750 LTE-A sites across South Africa to date. Rain is on track to meet its target of rolling out 2,000 sites by the end of the year. Users can see if they are covered by using Rain’s coverage map. “We’re very excited about the opportunity of selling LTE-A services over the Rain network,” Webafrica told MyBroadband. “We’re busy formulating the various packages and pricing, and will release these to the public at a future date.” MWEB said Rain will complement its ADSL and fibre products, and it also plans to launch packages soon. “We’re just working out the details, including sales and support journeys,” said Carolyn Holgate, general manager of product and sales. Afrihost said it is currently in talks with Rain. “We can’t give any other indications regarding price and launch dates at the moment,” it said.
