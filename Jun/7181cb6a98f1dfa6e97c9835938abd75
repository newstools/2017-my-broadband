Microsoft has announced a major redesign for the Skype mobile app, which includes a new “Highlights” feature that lets users temporarily show photos and videos to contacts. Much like Snapchat’s Stories, Highlights lets you create a “highlight reel” of your day. To post a Highlight in Skype, access your camera, take a photo or video, then post it to your Highlights. When you post a Highlight, your contacts can react to it with emoticons or by jumping into a conversation. Skype has also added support for add-ins and bots, the ability to customise the colours of the interface, and to react to messages or calls with emoticons.
