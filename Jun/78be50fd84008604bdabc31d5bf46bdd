MTN has been guilty of poor corporate management, but there is a big difference between how it and the ANC handles a crisis. This is according to Wayne McCurrie, a senior portfolio manager at Ashburton Investments. McCurrie made the statement about MTN on BusinessDay TV. MTN has faced numerous challenges in recent years, including a legal battle with Turkcell for over R50 billion. The Turkish operator alleges that MTN unlawfully secured the Iranian mobile phone operating licence that Turkcell won in 2004 – using bribery and corruption. Despite MTN’s regulatory and legal battles, McCurrie believes there can be value in the company. “If you believe the management will sort out the problems, and if you believe the South African economy is not going to implode, then MTN is good value on a long-term basis,” he said. Unlike the ANC government, MTN is trying to address its problems by improving its corporate governance with a new management team. “The difference between MTN and the government is that the guys who caused the trouble and made all the mistakes [at MTN] get kicked out,” said McCurrie. David Shapiro, deputy chairman at Sasfin Securities, agreed, saying MTN is trying hard to clean its house. However, both Shapiro and McCurrie warned that while MTN’s share price seems to be close to its bottom, it is not clear when it will start to increase. Shapiro added that the mounting social pressure on mobile data prices may put more pressure on local mobile operators.
