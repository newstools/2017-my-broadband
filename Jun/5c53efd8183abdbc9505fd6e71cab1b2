NASA has discovered 219 new exoplanets – planets which exist outside of our solar system and orbit their own stars – 10 of which occupy potentially-habitable zones. The 10 planets are Earth-like in size and position relative to their stars, meaning they have the potential to support water and life. Using Kepler space telescope data, NASA can determine the size and orbit of the planets to an accurate degree. “This carefully-measured catalogue is the foundation for directly answering: How many planets like our Earth are in the galaxy?” said scientist Susan Thompson. The new data follows the discovery of several Earth-like exoplanets earlier this year, which orbit a nearby dwarf star.
