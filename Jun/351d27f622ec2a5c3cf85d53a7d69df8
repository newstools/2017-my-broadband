Netflix has announced that after 23 episodes, the story of the Sense8 cluster is coming to an end. Sense8 is a science fiction drama created by Lana and Lilly Wachowski and J. Michael Straczynski for Netflix. The show portrays eight strangers from different parts of the world who suddenly become “sensates” – human beings who are mentally and emotionally linked. “It is everything we and the fans dreamed it would be: bold, emotional, stunning, kick ass, and outright unforgettable,” said Netflix. “Never has there been a more truly global show with an equally diverse and international cast and crew.”
