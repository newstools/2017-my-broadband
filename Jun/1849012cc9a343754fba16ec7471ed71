Volvo and Nvidia announced they are working with more companies to develop self-driving vehicle systems. According to a report by Engadget, the companies want the systems to be implemented at the start of 2021. Volvo has partnered with Autoliv to create a new software development subsidiary called Zenuity. The pair will work with Nvidia to build vehicle systems based on Nvidia’s Drive PX AI module. “This is the same module that Tesla already uses and which both Audi and Toyota have begun developing on,” stated the report. Nvidia is also working with ZF and Hella to develop a non-exclusive autonomous steering system.
