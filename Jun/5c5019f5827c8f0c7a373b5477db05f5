Intel has stated on its website that its compute modules have been discontinued. The Galileo, Joule, and Edison mini computers will be unavailable for purchase after 16 September 2017. Intel’s compute modules featured a similar form factor to the Raspberry Pi and were aimed at IoT developers and hobbyists. The boards were compatible with the Arduino ecosystem, meaning consumers could use breakout boards and components supplied by Arduino to expand the functionality of Intel’s compute modules. Last-time orders for the Intel boards will be shipped before the end of the year.
