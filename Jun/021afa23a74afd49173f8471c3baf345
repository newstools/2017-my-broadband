ABSA is making ATM interactions “quicker, smarter, and more convenient”, with personalised services. The bank said its ATMs will offer personalised services and settings to users, which will save customers time. This includes: The system will also detect elements like withdrawal amounts at certain times of the month or money transfers, and will provide them under a “favourite” transaction option. “Where it would normally take around 50 seconds for a consumer to perform an ATM transaction, it now takes them just 20 seconds thanks to the personalisation functionality,” said Allen Mahadeo, Head of Self Service Channel and Branchless Banking. The personalisation system will be rolled out across South Africa and will be completed by the end of July 2017. “In the near future, this functionality will include visible credit limits, along with an option for personal loans and overdrafts.”
