Accenture, in partnership with Microsoft and Avanade, has developed an identity prototype based on blockchain technology. The identity prototype was developed in support of ID2020, a public-private partnership dedicated to solving the challenges of identity. Approximately one-sixth of the world’s population cannot participate in many aspects of life because they lack documented proof of their existence. The goal of ID2020 is to make digital identity a reality, using blockchain and biometric technologies. The prototype runs on Microsoft Azure, and does not store any personally-identifiable information – instead tapping into existing “off-chain” systems when the individual user grants access. It is designed to interoperate with existing identity systems and aligns to principles of the Decentralized Identity Foundation. It uses the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance’s private, or “permissioned,” blockchain protocol. Accenture will also use its Unique Identity Service Platform that can manage fingerprints, iris, and other data.
