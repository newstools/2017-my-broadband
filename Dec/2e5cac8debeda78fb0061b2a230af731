I was walking my IoT the other day when this AI came up to me asking about IT’s relevance in a world of VR and VAR. I 4G’d at the absurdity of such a question. Everyone knows you can’t begin to #3-D print without some form of PhD. Duh. Today’s technology is advancing faster than most people can decipher logic from hogwash in the previous sentence. With Samsung’s new offering, you don’t need to understand any of the complicated terminologies offered up be tech geeks. Bixby is a recently launched, highly intelligent virtual assistant for smartphones, which offers a new way to interact with your phone. Its smart interface makes engaging with your device, services and apps more intuitive and seamless. Simply put, Bixby will be there for you at 2 o’clock in the morning when neither of your friends is up for a two and half hour telephone conversation. Here are ten things you don’t (and need to) know about Bixby. For example, you could ask Bixby to “send the picture just taken to Mom,” Bixby will know which photo you are referring to and will text it to your mom. Already Bixby has over 10 million users worldwide and that number is set to grow exponentially when Samsung integrates Bixby into its other smart appliances like Tvs and web operating fridges. Whether you have a walkable IoT, a PhD in IT or simply use your device as a mobile office, Bixby is here to make your life easier in the process.
