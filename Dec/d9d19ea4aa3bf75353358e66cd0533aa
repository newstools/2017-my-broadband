UK-based ISP owner Adrian Kennard has published details on how he used a piece of wet string to support an ADSL connection of 3.5Mbps. Kennard explained in a blog post that a key aspect of broadband technologies, like ADSL, is its ability to adapt to the length and characteristics of the line on which it is deployed. “We have seen faults on broadband circuits that manifest as the system adapting to much lower speeds. This is a key factor as a service can work, but unusually slowly, over very bad lines,” he said. This prompted him to test if a broadband connection is possible over a piece of string. Kennard showed how he used a 2-metre piece of string, which was dipped in salt water, to build an ADSL connection. “Not even that slow (3.5Mbps down), though slow uplink. Don’t dare touch the string though,” he said. “As a bonus, fit tin cans to both ends and you get voice as well as broadband on the same wet string,” he joked.
