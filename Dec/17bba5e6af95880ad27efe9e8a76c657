Telkom said it is working to ensure uninterrupted connectivity for customers, including those affected by copper cable theft in South Africa. The company is aware of the growing cable theft problem in the country and is exploring ways to ensure customers stay online. “Cable theft is a serious problem in South Africa and it has a significant impact on Telkom and thousands of Telkom customers each year,” Telkom told MyBroadband. “Telkom is taking every step to ensure that our network is secure and, more importantly, that our customers receive a seamless network experience free of criminal interference.” Telkom customers have told MyBroadband that following incidents of cable theft in their area, Telkom has offered to migrate them to LTE or fibre services. This is particularly the case if cable theft has happened multiple times. “In order to ensure uninterrupted service for our customers, Telkom is ramping up efforts to migrate customers to wireless and fibre technologies to ensure connectivity and limit the risks of cable theft,” it said. “In our efforts to ensure that our customers enjoy uninterrupted connectivity we offer LTE and Fixed Line Look-A-Like technology platforms as alternatives.” In certain areas where cable theft is common, Telkom may opt to migrate customers to its LTE or fibre services instead of replacing the copper cables – due to the improved reliability of the more modern solutions. “These platforms offer improved reliability and service sustainability due to reduced risk of environmental impact – service outages due to lightning and rain – and the risk associated with cable theft,” said Telkom. Telkom said its fibre network is the next step in fixed-line infrastructure, and is less susceptible to theft, electronic interference, and lightning and water damage compared to copper lines. “Fibre is the next evolution of fixed-line broadband connectivity and we want our customers to enjoy the best technology experience we can offer.”
