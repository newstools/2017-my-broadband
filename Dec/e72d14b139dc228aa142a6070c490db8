Cell C launched its Black entertainment platform in November 2017, taking a spot at the video streaming table. It features video rentals, live channel streaming, and subscription on-demand services similar to Netflix. The subscription services on Black are also available on monthly, weekly, weekend, and daily options. Its high-end package with local and international content, Flexi Premium, is R39 per day, R45 per weekend, R60 per week, or R99 per month. This makes it a competitor to services like Netflix and Showmax in South Africa. To see how the services compare, we used JustWatch to display what the packages have to offer. JustWatch specialises in detailing films and series available in a country, listing the number of titles services have available in South Africa. The table below summarises how Black’s Flexi packages compare to the rest of the subscription video on demand field in South Africa.
