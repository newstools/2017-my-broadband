2017 saw significant triumphs in the technology sector. There have been major advances in the fields of robotics and machine learning, while cryptocurrencies have seen a meteoric rise in value and usage. The biggest victories in technology in 2017 are listed below. Artificial intelligence and robotics are rapidly becoming mainstream, Vodacom’s head of innovation Jannie van Zyl told MyBroadband. Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot performed backflips, and an AI passed a medical exam this year. “Both these events were trigger events,” said van Zyl. There has also been a rapid deployment and acceptance of self-driving cars, which could change the way people move.  MyBroadband founder Rudolph Muller listed the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as his biggest technology triumph of the year. “It went from a tech hobbyist’s domain to more mainstream adoption, and is still gaining momentum,” he said. Bitcoin and Ethereum have dominated headlines in 2017, thanks to their rise in value.  Van Zyl also selected the European Union’s attempt to force over-the-top players to start sharing revenue with the creators of the content they are monetising as a highlight. Google may have to compensate news outlets for using their content on Google News, for example.  Van Zyl said the standardisation of 5G was another win in 2017. Initially it looked as though the soonest 5G standardisation would happen is 2020, but a group of over 40 companies worked together to speed it up. Qualcomm said the process would be finished in the first half of 2019 and mass adoption of the standard would happen by 2020.
