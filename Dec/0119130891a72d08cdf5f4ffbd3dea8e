Afrihost is seeing massive demand for fibre from its customers, and not nearly enough infrastructure to satisfy this demand. Over the past year, Afrihost has seen growth in all its sectors – but two areas stood out: fibre and Rain’s fixed LTE-A service. “We plan to offer a lot more in this vein and look for opportunities to add to our client’s experience with these products,” said Afrihost. Fibre is an excellent growth area for the ISP, with its fibre activations team connecting thousands of clients per month. “We expect increased coverage and access to fibre to create opportunities for us to offer more to our clients,” it said. The biggest challenge is a lack of fibre infrastructure, and even with LTE-A options filling the gaps, demand still outstrips supply. “Last-mile connections will continue to be rolled out and we need better spectrum allocation to drive fixed-wireless broadband,” said Afrihost. Afrihost expects the demand for uncapped fibre to remain strong in 2018, with those who cannot access fibre expected to look at affordable fixed-wireless options – like LTE-A packages. To serve the growing market, Afrihost will streamline its fibre process, help speed up installations, and make the entire customer experience as simple as possible. “We have also recently made a huge investment in growing our staff complement to reduce call centre turnaround times, and will continue to invest in all our other products to ensure a quality experience for our clients.”
