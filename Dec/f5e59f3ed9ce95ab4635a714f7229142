Huawei is “focused on resuming services to customers” following store closures in South Africa. Huawei Consumer Business Group South Africa confirmed to MyBroadband that five of its retail stores have been closed. The stores were run in partnership with Fantastic 1 Mobile. “Huawei CBG South Africa is focused on resuming services to our customers inconvenienced by the closure of the stores, as soon as is possible,” it said. It was reported by TechCentral that the stores were closed due to non-payment by Huawei for money it owed Fantastic 1 Mobile. The amount was said to be R22 million. “Huawei disputes the allegations made by Nisaar Ally, owner of Fantastic 1 Mobile,” said Huawei. The company said it has “strict financial processes which require proof of work” to be supplied before funds are released. “Several attempts were made to obtain the required proof of work in order to initiate the payment – this was not forthcoming, resulting in the matter as it stands.” Huawei also disputed the amount of R22 million, and stated it was not responsible for any of “Fantastic 1 Mobile’s financial problems”. “The closure of the five stores will not deter Huawei from achieving its global strategy of working with committed local partners to provide our customers with the best possible user experience,” it said. “Our latest store which opened in the Western Cape with a different partner has been doing exceptionally well.”
