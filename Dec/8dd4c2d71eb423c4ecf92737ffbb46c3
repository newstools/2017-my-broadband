Creative Media Works, operating as BBM Messenger, has partnered with Uber to launch the Uber service within the BBM app. The service is available on the Android and iOS versions of BBM and allows users to book an Uber ride without leaving the app. Users can access the Uber service through the BBM Discover menu and do not require the Uber app to be installed on their device. When launched from within the BBM app, Uber will require riders to sign in with their mobile number or social media account. The app uses the m.uber platform to integrate the Uber service into BBM. m.uber is a web client available globally which offers the Uber app experience regardless of location, network speed, or device.
