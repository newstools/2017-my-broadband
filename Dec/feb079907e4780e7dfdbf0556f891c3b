Absa’s credit card call centre is informing clients that an IT issue is causing transactions from 17 December to not reflect in their accounts. Transactions were reflected accurately yesterday evening, with clients discovering this morning that they were reverted in error. The problem is also causing accounts to show an available balance of zero, resulting in cards being declined. Absa’s call centre is currently overloaded, with wait times of over ten minutes to get through to the Premium banking credit card help desk. The bank’s customer support said the IT department is aware of the issue and that it is expected to be resolved this evening when a batch process runs. Absa told MyBroadband the problem is due to a technical error affecting customers who conducted inter-account transfers into their credit cards on the 17th December 2017. The bank said the incident was isolated and only affected a limited number of credit card customers. Absa confirmed that a batch process would be run tonight to correct the error.
