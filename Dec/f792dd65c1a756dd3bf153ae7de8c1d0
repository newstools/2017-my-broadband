In a stunning South African box office haul, Disney’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi raked in close to R10m. Star Wars: The Last Jedi opened the weekend in first place according to box office haul, not just in South Africa, but also in North America and another 53 territories ranging from Iceland and Australia to Norway, and from New Zealand to Switzerland. Only in Turkey, South Korea, India and Malaysia did The Last Jedi not open in first place, with the film only opening in China in January 2018. Episode VIII , directed by Rian Johnson, is a hit in South Africa as it is worldwide, ranging from normal cinemas as well as 3D and Imax theatres where theatre-goers are queuing up like crystal foxes to enter and see the latest instalment in that space saga set in a galaxy far, far away. Disney tells Channel24 that Star Wars: The Last Jedi’s 3-day box office weekend since its Friday, 17 December release came in at just under R10m in South Africa – R9 916 146 ($777 822). This ranks as the second biggest December industry opening day and weekend ever in South Africa, only behind Star Wars: The Force Awakens . The Last Jedi is also Disney’s biggest opening day for the year in the country. It’s important to note that The Force Awakens had a 5-day opening weekend to reach its R16 443 117, versus the almost R10m that The Last Jedi did in its 3-day opening, making The Last Jedi ’s opening haul incredibly impressive. The Last Jedi dominated the international box office in its opening weekend in 54 markets where it made $230.8m besides its North American haul of $220m. It means that Star Wars: The Last Jedi ranks as the 5th best international box office opening weekend ever. Channel24
