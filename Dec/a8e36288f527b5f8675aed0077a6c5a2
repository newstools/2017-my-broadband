Patreon has reversed a change in the way it processes pledges after subscribers protested by cancelling their donations, reported the Washington Post. The platform rolled out the change last week, which was aimed at allowing artists to keep a bigger percentage of donations. Processing fees for each payment used to be deducted from the donations, and on small donation amounts like $1, creators would receive around $0.90 after Patreon deducted fees. The change saw the bill for fees added onto pledges – 2.9% of the payment, plus a flat fee of $0.35. This would make a $1 donation cost fans $1.38. Subscribers were upset by change and many cancelled their support for creators. Following the backlash, Patreon co-founder Jack Conte apologised and said they would reverse the policy change.
