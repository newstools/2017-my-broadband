Gfycat is working to increase the quality of GIFs using machine learning. According to a report by TechCrunch, the online GIF platform is building AI-powered tools to increase the fidelity of GIFs across its service. The platform will search the web for the original video the GIF originated from and produce a higher-quality GIF. The lower-fidelity GIF will then be swapped out for the higher-quality version. The AI features will also be able to automatically identify and tag celebrities included in GIFs.
