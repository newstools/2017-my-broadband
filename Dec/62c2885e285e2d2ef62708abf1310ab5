Poynting has launched its new RF antenna testing facility in Samrand, South Africa. Poynting is known for its high-quality designs and products, with their superior performance the result of continuous testing and innovation. The company’s drive to continually improve has necessitated the commissioning of a new testing facility which is custom-designed to suit Poynting’s stringent requirements for antenna performance measurement and characterisation. Antenna performance is not easily quantified by end-users and performance is often overstated or inaccurately portrayed by manufacturers. The new antenna testing facility includes a custom-designed and manufactured anechoic chamber which allows testing from 450MHz to 5 GHz. Testing facilities like these are often outsourced by manufacturers, and Poynting’s decision to have its own facility was based on the need for extensive and thorough testing Images of Poynting’s new antenna testing chamber are shown below.
