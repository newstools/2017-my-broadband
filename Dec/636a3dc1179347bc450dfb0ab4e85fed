In 2018, MultiChoice will continue expanding the reach of its Internet TV services to more devices and more customers. “We want to offer our customers the chance to enjoy their DStv entertainment when they want to watch it, wherever they are,” it told MyBroadband. 2017 has been a good year for the company in terms of technology improvements and service enhancements. DStv’s Compact Plus and Compact customers joining Premium customers in accessing DStv Now was one of its highlights. “They can now stream live TV channels and watch an extended catalogue of Catch Up titles according to their package, at no extra cost,” said MultiChoice. Many channels were also added to live streams on DStv Now, including Comedy Central, SuperSport 10, SuperSport 11, Cartoon Network, CNN, and eNCA. The number of live streaming channels available on DStv Now for Premium customers has risen to 89, Compact Plus to 74, and Compact to 61. MultiChoice also released a new USB Wi-Fi connector, which makes it much easier to connect an Explora decoder to the Internet and access the expanded Catch Up Plus catalogue. This drive from MultiChoice is set to continue in 2018, with many enhancements planned for its Internet TV products.
