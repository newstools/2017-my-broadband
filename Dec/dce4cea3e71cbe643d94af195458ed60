Cell C’s C-Fibre service has seen a 300% growth in customer numbers since the beginning of 2017, Cell C CEO Jose dos Santos told MyBroadband. Dos Santos added that the proliferation of fibre-to-the-home services across South Africa has been a game changer in 2017. “While there has been movement in this area of the business before now, 2017 really saw accelerated growth for us in this space,” said dos Santos. This is not the only success story for the company. Dos Santos said the completion of Cell C’s recapitalisation transaction with Blue Label was one of the highlights for them in 2017. “After two years of hard work, we have ensured a sustainable future for the company and its employees. Cell C now has a foundation from which to drive competition.” Another big development for Cell C was the launch of its entertainment platform, Black. “We have put a lot of time and thought into the launch of this service, and some of the platform’s functionalities are a first in SA.” Dos Santos said the single biggest input cost for the company is network equipment and the rollout of infrastructure. “For competition to really thrive and data costs to come down, we need to see the implementation of a national broadband network or more cooperation between mobile operators in terms of infrastructure sharing,” said dos Santos. “This is the only way input costs will decline and competitive rates are passed on to consumers.” Dos Santos added that broadband is relatively established as a commodity, and they expect to see value-added service offerings to consumers grow in 2018. “It’s one way of ensuring stickiness and preventing telco players from simply providing megs and minutes.” The value-added services will likely come in the form of content, which they expect to grow rapidly in 2018. “With telecommunications companies able to provide converged services, this is likely to be where the growth will come from.”
