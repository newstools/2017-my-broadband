OfferZen has revealed that data scientists and NodeJS programmers were in high demand in 2017. OfferZen is a recruitment platform that helps South African software developers find work. Developers are listed on the platform and companies make contact with them by sending an interview request. As part of the interview request, companies give upfront salary information. OfferZen initially focussed on programmers, but expanded its placement offering to data science, UI/UX design, and product management in October. Over the last year, OfferZen’s marketplace has grown by over 400% and the company’s staff complement increased from 9 to 34. Over 375 companies joined the platform this year, and there are now over 670 companies using OfferZen. OfferZen cofounder Malan Joubert told MyBroadband data scientists are in high demand as more companies realise there’s truth to the saying “data is the new oil”. “The fact that the open-source data science tools are improving quickly means that small companies can solve problems that were previously only possible for the likes of Google and Facebook,” said Joubert. He added that “the new hipster technology that startups are using is NodeJS”. “This year we saw a big rise in the demand for Node developers, and I think that will continue in 2018,” said Joubert.
