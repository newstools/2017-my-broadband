Vox has shown exceptional growth in 2017, increasing its revenue by 31% in tough economic conditions. This growth, Vox CEO Jacques du Toit told MyBroadband, is mainly attributed to the focus on rolling out fibre to homes and businesses, and their “highly-competitive fibre bundles”. The company remains focused on this area, and will continue to aggressively grow its fibre network in 2018. “We partnered with 11 well-known property developers who selected Vox Frogfoot as their exclusive supplier of fibre and ICT services to differentiate their own offering to the market,” said du Toit. “We have just over 108,000 homes and thousands of businesses lined up for the year.” Apart from rolling out fibre, Vox also plans to shake up the market with a unique fibre offering. “We will be launching an extremely unique fibre bundle towards the end of January – something that no one has tried to do before,” said du Toit. The company will also expand its channel programme, and will play a significant role in developing and integrating Internet of Things applications. “Our initial focus will be in asset tracking and various monitoring applications,” said du Toit.
