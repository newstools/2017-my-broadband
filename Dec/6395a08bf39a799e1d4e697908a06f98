The popularity of CryptoKitties has demonstrated that decentralised applications can attract mainstream attention. Built on Ethereum, CryptoKitties saw thousands of players using cryptocurrency to purchase, trade, and breed digital cats. All of the game’s logic was implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, with the website and its server only providing a user interface for the game. The interest and activity this game brought to Ethereum prompted a team of developers at Loom Network to create a new online learning tool called CryptoZombies. CryptoZombies is a free, interactive resource which teaches developers how to create and implement games on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum’s smart contracts are written in Solidity, a programming language designed for the blockchain. CryptoZombies aims to teach developers the basics of Solidity through a series of interactive lessons. CryptoZombies walks users through the process of creating a CryptoKitties-like game one lesson at a time, with each lesson focusing on different aspects of Solidity and other skills required for blockchain development. Users do not require any prior knowledge of Solidity to work through the material, although a basic understanding of programming and blockchain technology is helpful. Loom Network plans to release new lessons to the CryptoZombies platform every week, and users can earn achievements and collectible stickers by completing lessons. All lessons and Solidity coding take place in the platform’s browser window, and all lessons on the platform are free. Loom Network aims to build a platform for running decentralised applications on Ethereum side-chains, including decentralised games on the scale of StarCraft. “Games are one of the areas where we think blockchain will really revolutionise things,” it said. “So we built CryptoZombies to help educate and inspire the next generation of blockchain game devs.”
