Samsung has launched its Bixby voice assistant in 200 countries, including South Africa. The company said Bixby will be available in US English and Korean. “Bixby brings enhanced smartphone productivity and personalisation through Quick Commands, a feature that allows you to create a custom voice command to use in place of a sequence of one or more commands,” said Samsung. “For example, you can use the command good night as a shortcut for turn on Do-not-disturb mode, set an alarm for 6:00, and turn on blue light filter.” Samsung said Bixby is not a standalone app, but rather an “intelligent interface” – which lets applications become Bixby-enabled. “Bixby will support almost every task that the application is capable of performing using voice, touch, or text.” Samsung said it plans to expand Bixby’s voice capabilities to additional countries, languages, devices, features, and third-party applications going forward. Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ users can enable Bixby by pressing the Bixby button.
