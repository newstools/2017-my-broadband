Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently visited Lagos in Nigeria, and announced the allocation of $2.5 million in funding to Siyavula – a South African maths and science venture, TechCrunch reported. The funding forms part of Google.org’s allocation of $20 million in grants over the next five years to non-profit organisations that are “working to improve lives across Africa.” Nigerian professional development startup Gidi Mobile also received funds of $2.5 million. Google.org will assign another $5 million through its African Impact Challenge in 2018, it said.
