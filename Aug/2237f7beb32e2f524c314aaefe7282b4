LG has announced that its next high-end smartphone, the LG V30, will have an f/1.6 lens on its rear camera – the largest aperture among smartphone cameras. It also confirmed the LG V30 will have a dual-camera system and that the lens will be glass. “The glass Crystal Clear Lens also delivers greater light-collecting ability than a plastic lens as well as better colour reproduction,” said LG. This will reduce edge distortion by 33%. LG said the rear camera on the V30 will be 30% smaller than the one on its predecessor, the V20.
