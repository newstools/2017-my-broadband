Dell has unveiled a new piece of VR tech, the Dell Visor. The Visor was made in partnership with Microsoft and is compatible with the Windows Mixed Reality platform. “Engineered with a flip-up visor for convenient transitions, it features well-cushioned head and face padding, thumbwheel band adjustment, and smart weight balancing,” said Dell. Dell said the Visor uses the same technology as the Microsoft HoloLens – including inside-out tracking cameras with a 360-degree panoramic view. “The headset itself is able to scan surroundings instead of satellite emitters positioned inside the room. Its future-proof tech extends to platform-agnostic communication, with the possibility of users interacting with owners of different MR headset brands down the road.” The Visor can also be paired with Dell Visor Controllers, which offer users “total control with haptic feedback”. A headset and controller bundle will sell for $449.99 in the US in the coming months. A standalone headset is $349.99. More details about the Visor are set to be announced on 1 September, said Dell.
