redPanda Software is an exciting, energising company to be a part of – one that is driving the IT industry forward, says Allan Dickson, redPanda Software chairman. Software development has come a long way in recent years, demanding new modes of working that allow developers to keep pace with the demands placed on the industry. “I have been in and around the industry for the last 40 years, and I’ve seen phenomenal change in the software developer ecosystem with new frameworks and open source software being introduced,” Dickson says. “Yet the biggest change I’ve seen is in the shift from Waterfall to Agile methodologies, which is used at redPanda Software, which has resulted in more effective sharing of information, more regular delivery to customers, better productivity and better delivery of what the end user wants.” This shift has allowed redPanda Software to cultivate an impeccable track record of delivering quality software solutions and support to both local and international clients. As such, in the past five years, redPanda Software has enjoyed phenomenal growth as a business, as well as in the technology it uses, its client base, and the individuals that make up its teams. When Dickson joined redPanda, he was highly impressed by the innovative work they were doing for a large retail organisation. “It is like they were changing the tyre of a truck that was moving at 40kmph,” Dickson explains. “I wanted to expose redPanda to a broader base of customers and find opportunities to share experience, skill and wisdom with as many people as possible, as it is the people within redPanda that drives this innovation.” Sharing forms a big part of redPanda’s culture, and the company has introduced a mentorship programme for emerging managers as well as its redAcademy, a training centre for careers in software development. “At redPanda, we believe it’s not only important to give people the space to grow, but to nourish them – giving them the opportunity for creativity through our Right Stuff room, which will benefit their software development,” Dickson adds. “This allows individuals to reach their full potential, as you cannot grow unless you are exposed to new things, including new customers, new technologies, new teams, and new creative skills.” As an employer, redPanda is focused on letting people grow, which is one of the secrets of their success. “A business thrives because of its people, and this is clear at redPanda where we are seeing incredible growth of not only the business, but of its employees, technology and customers.” In the years to come, Dickson predicts that redPanda will continue to drive this growth, with more customers both locally and internationally, and through increased development of its people. “I am proud to be the chairman of redPanda Software because it is an organisation I really love and I’m proud of the people that work here,” Dickson concludes. “It is a very exciting place to be, and I get energised just by rubbing shoulders with these young people and seeing what they’re capable of.” For more information, or to join the innovative, dynamic team, visit the redPanda Software website.
