Pilotless planes could save airlines up to $35 billion per year, but passengers are not ready to step onto fully-autonomous flights, according to a report by Fortune. A survey by UBS has shown that airlines would save $31 billion by reducing the cost of highly-skilled employees, $3 billion in training, and $1 billion in fuel if they made the switch. “The deployment of autonomous technology could result in significant fare cuts, an estimated one-tenth of the total in the US,” stated the report. However, a survey of 8,000 air passengers showed that 54% refuse to board a remote-controlled plane – even if ticket prices were lowered. “By the middle of the century, the majority may be willing,” said UBS. The report noted that modern aircraft already employ a host of automated systems, including ones which land the plane. Boeing recently stated it had started researching commercial passenger jets which will fly without pilots.
