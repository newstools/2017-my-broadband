Mazda has made a breakthrough in compression ignition engine technology that will be 20%-30% more fuel efficient than its current engines, Reuters reported. The report stated that Daimler and General Motors have been trying to develop the technology for decades, but Mazda developed it first. A homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine ignites petrol through compression, eliminating the need for spark plugs. Reuters reported that its fuel economy could match that of a diesel engine, without high emissions of nitrogen oxides or sooty particulates. It noted that Mazda’s engine still uses spark plugs under certain conditions, such as at low temperatures, to deal with the technical hurdles that prevented the commercialisation of the technology. Mazda said it will start selling cars with the new engine from 2019.
