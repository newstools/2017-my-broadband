Pre-order Studio Wildcard’s ARK: Survival Evolved before shipping of the full release to physical retail and digital stores begins on August 29. This dinosaur survival-adventure game will be available for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. Over the past two years, millions of ARK players worldwide have built gigantic bases, captured and trained armies of dinosaurs, crafted armoires full of weapons and eaten billions of berries. Now ARK is going to become even more fun with surprise new content at launch and beyond, with additional gameplay, creatures, and story elements. There are multiple ways to get your dino-fix with ARK: Survival Evolved, which are now available to pre-order. This base game includes everything a burgeoning Jurassic adventurer needs to get started in the world of ARK. It’s the core game, and all free content released up to this point, offering up hundreds of hours of gameplay to players. The Explorer’s Edition takes the base game, and adds even MORE – introducing a Season Pass that will grant access to all expansion packs, starting with Scorched Earth (available now) and including more packs launching later this year and into 2018. “The evolution of ARK has taken a 2-year journey through early access, and the full version will demonstrate that the extra time in development was put to good use,” said Doug Kennedy, CEO and Co-Founder Studio Wildcard. “We spent the extra time squashing bugs, improving performance, enhancing the single player experience and delivering the end-game content that will reveal the full story of ARK. We’re excited to finally get it into the hands of survivors everywhere!” You can pre-order ARK: Survival Evolved from BT Games.  This article was published in partnership with Apex Interactive.
