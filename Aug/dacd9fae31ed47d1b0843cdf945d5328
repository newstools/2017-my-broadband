Uber South Africa has introduced a new cash indicator feature which allows drivers to choose whether they want to accept a cash trip or not. The feature follows feedback from drivers, who said they wanted to choose which kinds of trips they accept. The cash indicator will only appear to drivers on cash trips, and no indicator will pop up for trips paid using a credit card. Uber said drivers who decline a cash trip will not face any consequences, and the Uber app will alert another driver with no impact on the dispatch process. “While some driver-partners have asked for the cash option to be removed, other driver-partners feel the cash option has opened them up to new riders,” said Uber South Africa GM Jonathan Ayache. “We believe riders should have the freedom to pay for rides how they wish, but we also believe that driver-partners should have the freedom to accept cash trips or not.”
