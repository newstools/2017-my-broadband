Cybersmart has launched a new Lightspeed Free Forever Fibre prepaid deal, which gives users a 400Mbps service and 60GB of data per month for free. Instead of charging subscribers for the installation in installments over an extended period, there is an up-front installation cost of R4,999. After the service has been installed, a subscriber receives a 400Mbps connection, 10GB of anytime data, and 50GB of Night Data (midnight to 7:00) for free, for as long as they use the service. Should they need more data, they can purchase prepaid data bundles from Cybersmart at affordable prices. The data bundles have a validity period of 12 months, which means users can purchase large data bundles and use them over a year. Data prices are as low as 59c per GB in large packages. This lets users, using the fibre installation and 2,000GB/10,000GB package as an example, get: The Lightspeed Free Forever Fibre service also comes with a free intercom service in a building, should the body corporate agree to it. Cybersmart CTO Laurie Fialkov said the prepaid service is particularly popular in the buy-to-rent market, which makes it attractive to new tenants who know they have immediate access to FTTH. This is South Africaâ€™s first prepaid fibre-to-the-home service, and provides users with more flexibility than standard month-to-month subscriptions.
