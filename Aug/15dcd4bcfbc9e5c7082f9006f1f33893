UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd has told technology companies to step up the fight against extremism or face new laws. According to a report by the BBC, companies which provide messaging services are “not doing enough to beat the enemy on the Internet”. Encryption standards used by services like WhatsApp have become a problem, said Rudd – who is set to meet with Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft about the issue. As encrypted messaging services allow users to send information to one another without it being intercepted, governments have warned that terrorists are taking advantage of this security to plan attacks. Rudd’s statements follow Australia proposing a new cybersecurity law that will force technology firms to decrypt customer messages to aid police investigations. Those against the move have stated that removing encryption will violate users’ rights and reduce the security of messaging services.
