Vodacom has stated that a configuration change on its prepaid and top-up billing system – which proved to be problematic – resulted in users losing airtime and data. “We were able to roll back this process during the course of [Monday] night,” said Vodacom. The operator said Prepaid and Top Up subscribers who were active on the network were affected by the issue. Those affected by the billing bug complained about missing data and airtime depleting for no apparent reason. Vodacom said it will reimburse subscribers who were affected by the billing issue on Monday night. All out-of-bundle charges incurred during the incident are being refunded, and depleted bundles are being reinstated. “We have completed the vast majority of airtime refunds and reinstated impacted data bundles. We are committed to ensuring that all affected customers are refunded in full,” said Vodacom. “Vodacom confirms that it has reimbursed customers affected by last night’s billing issue and remains committed to ensuring that all customers are refunded in full,” said Vodacom. “We thank customers for their patience while the matter was being resolved and reiterate our sincere apologies for the inconvenience caused. Customers that may have outstanding queries are kindly requested to contact our call centre for resolution on 111.”
