Microsoft’s Xbox Live service experienced an outage on Tuesday evening, which lasted until Wednesday morning. According to the Xbox Live status page, services affected included logging in, playing multiplayer games, store access, game downloads, and the ability to play certain single-player games – unless you switched to offline mode. At around 07:00 South African time, Microsoft’s Xbox Support Twitter account announced that the problems were resolved. Several users were still complaining about Xbox Live issues, however, and Xbox support advised players to power cycle their consoles and restart their broadband routers.
