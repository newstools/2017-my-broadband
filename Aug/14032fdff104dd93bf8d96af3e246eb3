Microsoft now allows Skype users to send money to their contacts using PayPal. The feature is available through the Send Money add-on, which allows the transfer of funds using the mobile app. The first time you use the Send Money feature, youâ€™ll be asked to confirm your location and link your PayPal account to your Skype profile. This functionality has started rolling out to Skype mobile users on iOS and Android in supported countries. Send Money is not yet supported in South Africa.
