Dolby has announced a plan to build high-quality speakers for modern laptops, reported The Verge. The audio company has initially partnered with Huawei and implemented its new speakers in the MateBook X and MateBook D notebooks. Dolby’s initiative for notebook audio sees the company contributing to product design instead of only implementing its audio products in completed laptops. According to the report, Dolby’s research into laptop speaker design found many suboptimal configurations – including two speakers built by different manufacturers with different maximum volumes. The company told The Verge that more laptops with Dolby-designed speakers will be released soon, although it did not state whether it had partnered with other notebook manufacturers.
