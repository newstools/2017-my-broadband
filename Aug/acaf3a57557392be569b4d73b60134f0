At redPanda Software, we have devised a plan to address the current skills shortage affecting the software development industry in South Africa which includes growing our existing employees, providing internships, apprenticeships at our very own redAcademy and finally leveraging international team members for optimum skills transfer. We believe that a successful team is built on a strong management backbone that will ensure consistent workflow and outputs. We focus on internal training at both a management and technical level to raise the skills of all our employees. We also have a sound internship programme where we bring young students into our offices who have finished their tertiary studies and provide them with practical experience on how the industry operates. Generally, after a 12-month period, the candidates progress to our development teams for further training and skills transfer. The redAcademy is an apprentice-based training centre for careers in software development and is aimed at school leavers.  It provides comprehensive training in software development and within six months, candidates are working on live projects within the redPanda Software environment. redPanda Software is an expert in end-to-end custom software development. Our passion for gaining a deep understanding of each client’s business and providing bespoke solutions with value measurement, enables us to deliver only the highest quality solutions.
