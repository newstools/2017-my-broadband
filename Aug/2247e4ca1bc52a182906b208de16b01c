The Warr team from the Technical University of Munich took first place at SpaceX’s recent Hyperloop Pod competition, reported Engadget. The team’s Hyperloop pod reached a top speed of 323km/h before halting at the end of a 1.25km track. Warr’s pod was built for the competition, weighing 80kg and powered by a 50kW motor. The Hyperloop system is being designed by Tesla and SpaceX, and consists of a large vacuum tube through which electrically-powered pods can travel with minimal resistance.
