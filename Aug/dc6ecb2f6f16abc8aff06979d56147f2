Microsoft has announced that Windows 10 will soon get built-in eye tracking support and an experience called Eye Control. Eye Control makes Windows 10 more accessible to people with disabilities, letting them operate an on-screen mouse and keyboard, and text-to-speech system, using their eyes. The experience requires a compatible eye tracker, like the Tobii 4C. Eye Control is currently in beta and those interested in testing and providing feedback can sign up as a Windows Insider to access it. The feature is a product of the company’s One Week Hackathon, which encourages employees to focus on passion projects that advance the company’s mission of empowering people.
