Internet service providers offering Rain-based LTE-A packages recently launched a double data promotion and new big-cap products. Existing and new customer have access to the promotion. The double-data caps will be available until 30 November 2018, but customers must sign up before 30 November 2017 to benefit. With the new packages offering caps of up to 660GB, with speeds of between 10Mbps-50Mbps, Rain LTE-A products are starting to compete against fixed-line alternatives. One advantage of the Rain packages is that users only require an LTE-A router to use the service. This means those without access to fibre or DSL lines, or those with slow/poor DSL throughput, can benefit from LTE-A. Users will also not have to wait for any infrastructure to be installed – as the required Huawei B618 LTE-A router is a plug-and-play solution. Another advantage is that users will not have to pay for an Openserve analogue line and DSL line as they would on ADSL and VDSL packages. Where DSL packages beat Rain, however, is in the data-usage category. Many ISPs offer unlimited after-hours data – typically between midnight and 07:00 – on capped DSL accounts, and let your unused data at the end of the month roll over to the following month. On Rain’s packages, data does not roll over and there is no free “after-hours” data. Rain packages also require the upfront purchase of the Huawei router, and coverage is restricted to certain areas. If you are looking for an Internet connection until at least November 2018, the table below compares Rain’s new double-data packages against capped DSL packages available from prominent ISPs. Webafrica, Crystal Web, Afrihost, and MWEB are offering the new Rain packages. It must be noted that the above does not take DSL data rollover or after-hours data allocations into account.
