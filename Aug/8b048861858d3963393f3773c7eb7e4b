Intel has unveiled the specifications and prices of its new range of Core X processors, including the 18-core Extreme Edition. The processors are aimed at the high-end desktop market and are compatible with the LGA 2066 socket found on Intel’s X299 chipset. Intel’s Core X Series processors are based on the Kaby Lake-X and Skylake-X architecture, and are available in Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9 models. The chips do not feature any integrated graphics, as all die space is occupied by CPU cores. Intel said content creators can expect up to 20% better performance in VR content creation and up to 30% faster 4K video editing over the previous generation of Intel processors. Gamers will also see a performance improvement of up to 30% when multi-tasking. The Intel Core i9-7980XE Extreme Edition is the most powerful processor in the lineup, boasting 18 physical cores with 36 threads and a clock speed of up to 4.4GHz using Intel’s Turbo Boost 3.0 technology. The powerful CPU does not come cheap, however, and will retail for $1,999 (R26,000) in the US. Intel Core X processors with 14, 16, and 18 CPU cores will be available from 25 September, while lower-end products will start shipping from 28 August. The specifications and US pricing for Intel’s new Core X Series processors are below.
