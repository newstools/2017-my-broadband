Game developer Acid Wizard has uploaded a safe, protected torrent of its survival-horror game Darkwood to The Pirate Bay. The developer made the decision after a player asked for a refund, saying his parents would be upset when they saw the bill at the end of the month. Acid Wizard uploaded the full game to The Pirate Bay to allow gamers who could not afford it to play it. “We have just one request. If you like Darkwood and want us to continue making games, consider buying it in the future, maybe on a sale, through Steam, GOG, or Humble Store,” it said. The studio urged players not to purchase the game through key reselling sites, as these resellers “profit at the developer’s expense”. “Please, please, don’t buy it through any key reselling site. By doing that, you’re just feeding the cancer that is leeching off this industry.” Darkwood is available on Steam for R159.
