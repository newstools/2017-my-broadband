Samsung has developed a 1TB chip based on its V-NAND technology. V-NAND memory architecture stacks NAND cells vertically instead of placing them on a single 2D plane, allowing for greater density and reliability. The memory technology will be implemented in a range of devices including smartphones, consumer SSDs, and more in 2018. Samsung said the development of a 1TB V-NAND chip is one of the most important memory technology advancements of the last decade, and will allow a single V-NAND package to boast 2TB of storage capacity.
