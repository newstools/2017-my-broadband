Intel has shown off its new “Ruler” form factor for SSDs, which is aimed at providing data centres with a petabyte of storage in a single server rack. The new form factor removes size limitations imposed by 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch drive bays and sports a skinny, long shape. The device can comfortably fit in a single U1 server rack while remaining adequately cooled, said Intel. Intel confirmed that its Optane and 3D NAND solid state drives would be available in the ruler form factor in the near future.
