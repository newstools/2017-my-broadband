Nvidia has revealed its new external graphics cards, featuring Pascal Titan X or Quadro GPUs. External GPU (eGPU) products allow content creators and designers to accelerate the performance of lightweight notebooks with desktop-class professional graphics. “While more computer power than ever is needed for VR, photoreal rendering, and AI workflows, mobile systems are getting thinner and lighter, with limited performance and memory,” said Nvidia. “Our eGPUs can now solve this problem, enabling creatives to plug into our most capable GPUs so they can do their best work on the most graphically-demanding applications.” Nvidia has also updated its Titan X drivers to deliver increased performance in professional applications like video rendering, design, and AI. Quadro and Titan X eGPU products will be available from September 2017.
