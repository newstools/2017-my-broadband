Vodacom is giving 500MB of free data to customers affected by recent billing problems on its network. The data will be valid for three days and customers can check if they have received it by dialling *111#. Many Vodacom subscribers complained that their data was depleting for no apparent reason on 21 August. Vodacom acknowledged the problem and corrected the issue before working to reimburse customers. The provider later confirmed it had reimbursed all affected customers and apologised for the inconvenience – which was caused by a billing system issue. “We are allocating FREE 500MB data valid for 3 days to those customers, for the inconvenience caused,” said Vodacom.
