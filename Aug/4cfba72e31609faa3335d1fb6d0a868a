Google has launched an updated iOS app for Google Earth, with new features that were introduced for Android earlier this year. The update introduces guided tours, informational cards, integrated 360-degree videos, and Street View imagery. The iOS update means that iPhone and iPad users can now use Voyager, Google’s interactive travel story system. It includes multi-day itineraries for 17 cities and 140 stories. Knowledge Cards will also offer history and trivia about thousands of places and landmarks around the world.
