Microsoft has launched an Outlook.com beta programme, which gives users a look at future designs and functionality. “We are rolling out the beta and it could take some time to reach all our users,” said Microsoft. The first new features shown off include an updated design and improved search ability. This forms part of a “smarter inbox” in Outlook, which Microsoft said shows you Quick Suggestions as you type. It also includes an improved photo experience that puts all the pictures sent or received in your email in one place. Users are also able to personalise their inbox with their “favorite people and folders, to make it easier to find the friends, files, and conversations that matter”.
