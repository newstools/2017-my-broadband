Vodacom has around 1,600 people in its technology division, of which around 400 are in IT, 150 in enterprise, and 1,000 who work on its network. “It’s a big organisation that cuts across all areas of technology,” said Vodacom CTO Andries Delport. Delport said they don’t build or maintain their base stations – Vodacom outsources that function. There are probably two-to-three-times as many people working on Vodacom’s network and IT systems who are contracted from outside the company, said Delport. However, Delport said the size of the team is not important, but how it is structured. Vodacom has divided South Africa into eight regions, and around 25 counties. Each county has a leader, and they look after the roll-out and network quality in that area. This gives Vodacom “super focus” at a granular level, said Delport. This helps it maintain a high network quality standard from a national and regional perspective.
