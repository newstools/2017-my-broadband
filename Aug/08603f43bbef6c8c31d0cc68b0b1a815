DStv Now has broken its previous record for a live streaming audience with the fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr and Conor McGregor. “The daly live stream audience peaked at 40% above any previous high on the DStv Now platform,” said MultiChoice. “The Money Fight audience was 30-times larger than that for the Mayweather vs Pacquiao live stream just two years ago.” It said live sport has been one of the main drivers of growth for DStv Now in recent months. “DStv Now has grown monthly usage more than 50% in just three months, and has doubled in the last six months.” Other factors which have driven growth for the online platform include the addition of more live streaming channels – 19 since April – and providing the service to Compact and Compact Plus subscribers, said MultiChoice.
