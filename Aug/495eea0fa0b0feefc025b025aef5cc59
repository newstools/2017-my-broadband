A group of hackers, which claims to have hacked HBO, has leaked more data from the breach and revealed its motive, Wired reported. “Our demand is clear and Non-Negotiable: We want XXXX dollars to stop leaking your Data,” said the group. “HBO spends 12 million for Market Research and 5 million for GOT7 advertisements. So consider us another budget for your advertisements!” Last week, the attackers leaked several gigabytes of data online, including upcoming episodes of HBO series and the episode outline of the fourth episode of Game of Thrones season 7. Following the airing of the fourth episode, the group released the scripts of the first four episodes of the season, along with one for the unaired fifth episode. At the time of publication, the site where the hackers posted the information – Winter-leak.com – was down.
