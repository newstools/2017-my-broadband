Bang & Olufsen has launched what it calls the “future of sound” – its BeoLab 50 speakers. The speakers retail for $39,000 per pair (R520,000), and are marketed as the company’s first “loudspeaker”. The units deliver 2,100 watts, which is sent through three 10-inch woofers, three 4-inch midrange drivers, and one 0.74-inch tweeter – mated to seven 300-watt amplifiers. This is covered by a wood and aluminum body, and linked to cooling grills.
