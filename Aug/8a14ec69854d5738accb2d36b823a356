ICASA plans to change the End-user and Subscriber Service Charter Regulations with aggressive mobile data regulations. Those interested in commenting on the proposed regulations have 30 days to do so from 7 August 2017. It wants mobile operators to send SMS notifications at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% depletion of voice, SMS, or data bundles, and has mandated that networks must allow users to choose whether they want to use out-of-bundle data. This means Vodacom, MTN, and Cell C will have to stop you from continuing to use data for between R1 to R2 per MB when your bundle is finished. “A Licensee must ensure that an end-user is not defaulted automatically to out-of-bundle data charges upon depletion of data bundles,” said ICASA. “Where an end-user does not opt-in or opt-out of out-of-bundle data usage when a data bundle has been depleted, a Licensee must automatically disconnect the end-user from out-of-bundle data usage until such time that the end-user gives express consent or authorisation.” ICASA also mandates that the operator must give you the ability to top up your data. The proposed regulations also mandate set validity periods for data bundles, adding that operators must warn users seven days before their data expires. If you recharge before the expiry date of your current data bundle, your unused data should roll over to the following month, said ICASA. The validity periods are summarised in the table below. ICASA said these regulations will come into force when they are published in the Government Gazette.
