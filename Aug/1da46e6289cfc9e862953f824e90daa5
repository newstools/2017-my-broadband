Samsung vice chairman Jay Y. Lee’s attorney has filed an appeal against a five-year prison sentence Lee was handed for bribery, Reuters reported. Lee, the heir to the Samsung empire, was convicted of bribery, perjury, and embezzlement last week. He was detained in February following charges that he bribed former South Korean president Park Geun-hye, with the goal of securing control of the conglomerate that owns Samsung Electronics. Several former Samsung executives were also convicted, including former Samsung Corporate Strategy Office chief Choi Gee-sung, and former President Chang Choong-ki. They were each sentenced to four years in prison. Two other executives received suspended prison terms. Lee may be kept in detention for a maximum of four months while a court considers his appeal.
