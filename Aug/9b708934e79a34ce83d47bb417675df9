Microsoft has revealed a new deep learning hardware acceleration platform named Project Brainwave. The system is designed for real-time AI processing, which allows it to process multiple requests as quickly as it receives them with extremely low latency. Project Brainwave supports a wide range of deep learning software, including Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and TensorFlow. The company demonstrated its new system using the Intel Stratix 10 FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array). The Stratix 10 was able to deliver 39.5 TFLOPS of computing power with 1ms of latency using the Project Brainwave architecture. Microsoft said it is working to bring the Project Brainwave system to Azure, giving the service powerful capabilities for real-time deep learning processing.
