Samsung has released the Q9, its new 88-inch QLED TV, in North America and South Korea. The Samsung Q9 is set to be released in Europe later this month. “We are aiming to expand our footprint in the ultra-premium TV market with our ultra-large QLED TV models that embody the perfect combination of technology and art,” said Samsung. The Q9 boasts the ability to achieve 100% colour volume, has a near bezel-less design, and features a no-gap wall mount – which Samsung said lets you mount it flush against a wall. It also aims to remove cable clutter through its 1.88mm “Invisible Connection” transparent optical cable. This runs to a hub from which peripheral devices may be connected.
