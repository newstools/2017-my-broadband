MTN has the fastest mobile data speeds in Cape Town and surrounding areas, followed closely by Vodacom and Cell C, according to our latest tests. MyBroadband conducted speed tests using the MyBroadband Speed Test app for Android on four Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphones. The mobile speed tests – both stationary and driving – were conducted in 131 locations in and around Cape Town between 22-26 July. Data roaming was off for the tests, to ensure that the tests reflected the performance of the operators’ individual networks. This means Cell C and Telkom’s results are not what a typical user will experience, due to their roaming agreements with other networks. The results show that MTN achieved the fastest average download speed, Cell C had the fastest average upload speed, and Vodacom had the lowest average latency. The rankings were the same as MyBroadband’s Q2 tests in Cape Town, but the average speeds of all operators were significantly higher in Q3. The graphic below provides an overview of the results.
