Numerous Netgear routers have a security vulnerability which allows hackers to bypass authentication and hijack your admin credentials. Trustwave security researcher Simon Kenin said the security vulnerability affects a “large number of models”. “We have found more than 10,000 vulnerable devices that are remotely accessible. The real number of affected devices is probably in the hundreds of thousands, if not over a million,” he said. The vulnerability can be used by a remote attacker if remote administration is set to be Internet facing. By default, this is not turned on. “However, anyone with physical access to a network with a vulnerable router can exploit it locally. This would include public Wi-Fi spaces using vulnerable equipment.” He said with malware like the Mirai botnet, it is possible that certain vulnerable routers could be infected and used as bots. “If running a bot is not possible, the DNS can be changed to a rogue one, to further infect machines on the network,” he said.
