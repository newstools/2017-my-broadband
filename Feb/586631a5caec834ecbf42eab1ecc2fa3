Telkom is evolving and the way it rebranded BCX and Openserve provides an indication of the direction the company is moving, said BCX CEO Isaac Mophatlane. Mophatlane’s comments follow the rebranding of Telkom’s enterprise business division from Telkom Business Connexion to BCX. Absent from the new brand is the Telkom name and its blue colours. Mophatlane said Telkom Group CEO Sipho Maseko is quite clear that he wants distinct subsidiaries in the group. He said the company has evolved to have a smaller headquarters, with subsidiaries operating more independently in satellite offices. Openserve, Telkom’s wholesale and networks division, also doesn’t bear Telkom’s name in its branding. However, there is Telkom’s mobile division – which was initially called 8ta before being rebranded “Telkom Mobile” and then rebranded again as part of Telkom. Mophatlane said there is stable leadership in place at Telkom, including a stable board that is guiding the business, which means there is clear direction at the company. “Under Sipho’s leadership, Telkom is more predictable than before,” said Mophatlane. “This is as good as it’s going to get in terms of the new branding as it relates to BCX.”
