Google has announced that its Chrome app now supports websites with VR content. Android users with a Daydream View headset can access web-based VR content by navigating to the website in the app and putting on their headset. The feature is limited to Daydream View users with Daydream-compatible phones, although support could soon be added for other headsets – including Google Cardboard. Android and desktop users who don’t have a VR headset or Daydream-compatible device can still view web-based VR content, but are limited to navigating the scene using touchscreen or pointer controls. Google recommends a number of VR-enabled websites for users to explore, including a library of architectural scenes, a collection of VR films, and Sketchfab’s VR scenes.
