Consumers shopping for smartphones at Makro are greeted with a sign stating: “We regret to inform you that Cell C has terminated their trading with us”. The message states that Makro is unable to service its clients’ existing contracts or prepaid handsets, and advises users to visit a Cell C outlet for assistance. The termination of trading is between Cell C and Massmart – which operates Makro, Game, and Dion Wired stores. This raises the question: Why did Cell C decide to terminate its agreement with such a strong retail player? Cell C said it terminated its distribution agreement with Massmart in August 2016, based on a focus to build dedicated distribution channels “which will enhance service to our customers”. “Cell C wants to ensure that our customers receive the best experience throughout the service journey and get accurate information on our products and services wherever our brand is available,” said Cell C. “Our focus is now on partners which not only provide dedicated Cell C service points to service, sell, and educate, but also partners that share and live Cell C’s values and service ethos.” Customers who signed up for a contract or prepaid package at Makro, Dion Wired, and Game can visit any Cell C store, participating Edgars stores, Edgars Connect Stores, and Jet stores for assistance.
