Bitcoin has hit an all-time high, reported CoinDesk. Citing the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index – the index Google uses for its results – the report stated that Bitcoin’s previous highest level was $1,165.89 in November 2013. As of 24 February, it was sitting at over $1,200. Reports suggest that the prospect of the US Securities and Exchange Commission approving the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF – the first bitcoin ETF – has increased trader confidence. CoinDesk reported that the commission has a deadline of 11 March to make its decision.
