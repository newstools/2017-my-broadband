With only a month to go to the start of the 6th annual Cape Town International Animation Festival, here is a rundown of what you can expect from this year’s event. Adobe will showcase South African Illustrator and artist Caroline Vos. Vos will present the Adobe workshop, exhibiting her unique style and skills. Jeremy Matthews, CEO of Dax Data, a key local distributor for Adobe says, “We are pleased to announce Adobe’s partnership with the CTIAF, for the second year running”. Last year Dax Data and Adobe brought Matthew Gyves over from Adobe UK to demonstrate some of their animation software developments in Character Animator, Animate and After Effects CC. Labelled the Gateway to African Animation, the festival brings together the best of what the continent has to offer, as well as inspirational guest speakers from across the globe – all under one roof. Hosted at the River Club in Observatory with screenings at the Labia Theatre – this three-day spectacle of all things animation is the largest of its kind in Southern Africa. Attracting everyone from industry greats to creative kids, to participate in a host of workshops, viewings and masterclasses. The 2017 line-up includes international animators and produces like Farnaz Esnaashari-Charmatz from Nick Animation Studios – who worked post production on Dora The Explorer, Ivan Rouveure from Les Armateurs, and Veronique Encrenaz – Project Manager at MIFA, to name a few.
