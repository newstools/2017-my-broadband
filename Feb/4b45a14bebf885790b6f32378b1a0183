“We assure the youth that the lowering of the cost of data is uppermost in our policies and plans,” President Jacob Zuma said during his 2017 State of the Nation Address. No plans on how the government would reduce prices were announced. The pledge follows the #DataMustFall campaign started by Thabo “Tbo Touch” Molefe. Touch told South Africa’s mobile operators to lower their data prices or he will get everyone to move to a network “that cares about its customers”. The campaign ultimately cited faulty data to point out that South Africans were paying too much for mobile broadband. Two months after launching the campaign, Molefe’s online radio station, Touch Central, announced a deal with MTN which provided zero-rated data when listening to the station.
