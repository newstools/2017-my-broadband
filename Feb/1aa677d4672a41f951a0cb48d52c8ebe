Google has announced on the Chromium Blog that Chrome for iOS is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open-source repository. “Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform,” stated the post. “Due to constraints of the iOS platform, all browsers must be built on top of the WebKit rendering engine. For Chromium, this means supporting both WebKit as well as Blink, Chrome’s rendering engine for other platforms.” Google said this created complexities which it “wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base”. Developers can now compile the iOS version of Chromium “like they can for other versions of Chromium”.
