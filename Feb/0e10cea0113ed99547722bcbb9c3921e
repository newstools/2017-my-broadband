Activision Blizzard has launched a consumer products division to leverage its video game franchises. The company’s games include the Call of Duty series, Skylanders and Destiny from Activision, and Blizzard’s WarCraft, StarCraft, Diablo, and Overwatch. Tim Kilpin, a former executive at Mattel and Disney, will serve as the new division’s CEO. Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, and King Digital’s consumer product teams will join Kilpin in the new division. “Under Tim’s leadership, we will elevate our consumer product offerings to the same level of exceptional quality as our games and transform the ways audiences connect with the characters they love in their everyday lives,” said Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick.
