Google Allo users will receive a web app to run the chat service on their desktop in the future, said Google vice-president of communications Nick Fox. The WhatsApp competitor was announced in May 2016 – launching in South Africa in September. Fox tweeted a screenshot of the desktop version of Allo, which is in “early development”. The image shows what appears to be the Google Assistant bot – which could result in Google bringing its assistant to desktop users.
