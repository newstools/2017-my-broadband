The President did not say how the government plans to bring down prices, though, so we have put forward some suggestions. Frequencies that mobile networks can use to expand and improve their networks have been stuck in limbo for years. Asked how the price of data might be reduced in South Africa, the answer from operators is unanimous: release critical high-demand spectrum they can use in their mobile networks. This will allow operators to construct fewer new towers while increasing network capacity, which will reduce input costs. The assignment of spectrum in South Africa has been fraught with technical concerns, political interference, and failure to follow the right procedures. It’s time to get it done right.

A weak rand means more expensive network equipment, which is imported and paid for in US dollars.

In addition to spectrum, Vodacom said the following will help operators reduce prices:
