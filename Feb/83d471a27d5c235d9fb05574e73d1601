The first weekend after Valentine’s Day is the perfect time for you to take the money you did not spend on roses and dinner, and buy a piece of tech. Whether you saved on 14 February due to be single, being part of a couple who is not into the whole forced romance thing, or you are a scrooge – it does not matter. Roses die, chocolates melt, but a hard copy of Battlefield 1 will stay with you forever.
