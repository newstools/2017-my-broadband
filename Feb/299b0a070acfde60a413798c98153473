Newshost.za.net and Bitfarm.co.za are no longer available after receiving cease and desist notices from the Southern African Federation Against Copyright Theft (SAFACT). SAFACT informed the owners that their sites’ activities were unlawful as per the Copyright Act of 1978, and/or the Counterfeit Goods Act of 1997. After consulting with the site owners, SAFACT said they agreed to a settlement that saw all infringing content removed and the closure of the sites. “These sites were contravening the mentioned acts by making available for reproduction; diffusion; and/or communicating to the public without authorisation or consent from the copyright owner(s) and/or rights holder(s) relating to SAFACT member companies, content such as Films, TV Series, Interactive Games, and E-books,” said SAFACT. The sites now show the SAFACT logo with the following message: This site has been taken down by the Southern African Federation Against Copyright Theft for activities deemed unlawful as contemplated in terms of the Copyright Act, 1978 (Act 98 of 1978) and/or the Counterfeit Goods Act, 1997 (Act 37 of 1997.)
