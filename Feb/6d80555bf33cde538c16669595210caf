Signal has added an experimental video calling feature to the beta version of its app for Android. Experimental support for video and voice calling can be enabled through Signal Settings > Advanced > Video calling beta. To use the feature, both parties in the call must enable the beta on their device. The forthcoming Signal iPhone beta release will include the same functionality. Developed by Open Whisper Systems, SignalÂ uses the Signal Protocol to secure messages.
