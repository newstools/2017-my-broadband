Mobile in Africa Group, a distributor of Xiaomi products, has launched the Redmi 4A in South Africa. It is priced at R1,999, with the smartphone’s specifications promising a full-feature device. It boasts a 5-inch 720p display, 13MP rear camera, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 chip, 2GB RAM, and 16GB internal storage. A feature highlighted by Xiaomi is the phone’s dual-SIM capabilities. “To really benefit from data cost competition, consumers need to be free to switch to the best data deals as they wish,” said Xiaomi. Specials such as R1 for 250MB are great, but consumers face hurdles, such as number porting, to exploit them, said Xiaomi. “You can use one SIM to keep your current number and the other to switch your phone to a different network.” Afrihost has listed the Xiaomi Redmi 4A for R1,999 (or R100 pm for 24 months), which includes 500MB of data per month for 12 months.
