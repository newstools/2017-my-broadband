Samsung said it will launch a new device at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona at the end of February, with reports stating it is likely to be a tablet. The company said it will make an announcement at its press conference on the evening of 26 February. According to reports, Samsung will not announce a new flagship smartphone at the event, as it has in the past. Samsung recently announced a new quality assurance process for its smartphones, including an 8-point battery safety check, which may have delayed the launch of the Galaxy S8.
