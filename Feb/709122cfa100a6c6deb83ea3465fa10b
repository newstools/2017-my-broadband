Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said he is no longer participating in US President Donald Trump’s economic advisory council. “Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda, but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,” he said. The decision to leave the council may have been brought on by 200,000 Uber customers deleting their account, according to the New York Times. The publication said Uber employees also wrote “Letters to Travis” to inform the CEO how his involvement in the Trump council affected them. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, said he is not quitting the Trump council. He said participation in the council does not mean he supports the decisions made by the Trump administration. “Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the Administration,” he said. Musk said he will object to Trump’s recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions on how to change the policy.
