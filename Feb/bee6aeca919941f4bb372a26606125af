Microsoft’s personal assistant Cortana now reminds users of important events, even when they forget to ask. Cortana already gives users reminders for people, places, and times, and helps them make and manage to-do lists. It now goes a step further by checking a user’s emails, proactively suggesting a reminder about important commitments. “Using machine learning technology, Cortana automatically recognises when you make a commitment in email messages and will proactively suggest a reminder,” said Microsoft. “Cortana does all the work in the background, making this helpful feature incredibly easy to use.” Cortana’s suggested reminders are available in the US on Windows 10, with support coming to iOS and Android in the coming weeks.
