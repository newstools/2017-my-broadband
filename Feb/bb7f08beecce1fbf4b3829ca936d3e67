The newshost.co.za NZB index by the South African developer who goes by The Womble is offline. The Womble closed the index at the beginning of 2017, saying it had become difficult to maintain the code to provide reliable and comprehensive results. An NZB index is a website or service that provides links to NZB files. These files may be used by Usenet Newsgroup clients to retrieve posts from Network News Transfer Protocol servers. Clients who are NZB-capable will download and convert messages into the original binary file they represent. The Womble’s index was a popular default for many, as it didn’t require an account registration to access full functionality.
