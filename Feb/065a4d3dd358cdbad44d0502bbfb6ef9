Crystal Web has extended the availability of its new R1 mobile data promotion and will take on double the number of subscribers it planned to. Shaun Kaplan, CEO of Crystal Web, recently launched Crystal Mobile – a mobile data offering that runs over Vodacom’s last-mile network and breaks out to the Internet via Crystal Web. “We’ve seen spectacular interest in our new mobile data offering and it has so far exceeded our expectations,” said Kaplan. Crystal Web therefore decided to take on double the number of subscribers it had originally intended to. “The R1 promotion will continue to run for at least another few days or until capacity is reached, whichever comes first.” “We don’t want to over-subscribe our mobile service, which is a model that has proved very successful in our DSL offerings.”
