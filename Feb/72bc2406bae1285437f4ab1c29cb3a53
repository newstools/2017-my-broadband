The person who claimed responsibility for hacking mobile forensics company Cellebrite has posted cracking tools for older smartphones online, Motherboard reported. Cellebrite is the company the FBI turned to when Apple refused to create a backdoor for the agency to use on an iPhone. The FBI wanted Apple to create a version of iOS that would allow it to “brute force” the security code of an iPhone recovered in the investigation of the San Bernardino terrorist attack. Apple warned that creating a version of iOS with a back door would set a dangerous precedent and weaken the security of its devices. The hacker told Motherboard they released cracking tools stolen from Cellebrite that target older iPhones, and Android and BlackBerry devices.
