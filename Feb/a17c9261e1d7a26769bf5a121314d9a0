Cell C’s pricing and product changes kicked in on 1 February 2017. The changes affect voice contracts, data prices, and prepaid rates. Cell C informed users that in terms of their subscriber agreement, as well as the Consumer Protection Act, the company has the option of varying its charges from time to time. These charges include connection fees, subscription fees, usage charges, SIM card fees, goods fees, and any charges relating to the provision of Cell C’s services. One of the changes is that the Nite Data allocation will be removed from SmartData TopUp contracts which are activated from 1 February 2017. Customers who are currently in contract – or activated before 1 February 2017 – will continue to receive their Nite Data allocation until the end of their contract term. The free WhatsApp benefit on Trace Mobile will also be removed from 1 February. The price changes are detailed in the tables below.
