Facebook has announced two updates to better rank posts in users’ feeds, which include new signals to better identify and rank authentic content. It has also implemented a new way to predict and rank in real-time when posts might be relevant to a user. Facebook looks at multiple factors when ranking News Feed content, including how close a user is to the person or page posting, and the overall engagement (likes, comments, shares) that a post has. “If a post is likely to be authentic based on the new signals we look at, it might show up higher in your feed,” said Facebook. Facebook said it anticipates that most Pages won’t see significant changes to their distribution in News Feed. “Some Pages might see a small increase in referral traffic or outbound clicks, and some Pages might see minor decreases.”
