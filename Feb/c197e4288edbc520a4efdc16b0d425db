Beautiful Desolation, an isometric adventure game set in post-apocalyptic South Africa, is almost two-thirds of the way to its Kickstarter goal. The Brotherhood, the developers behind Stasis, set its Kickstarter goal for the game at $120,000 (R1.6 million). With two weeks to go in its campaign, it has raised over $79,000. To show off what it can do with its engine and isometric style, The Brotherhood released a free game called Cayne (Steam, GOG). Cayne is set in the same universe as Stasis, The Brotherhoodâ€™s sci-fi horror adventure which previously raised $132,000 through Kickstarter and went on to win several awards. If funded, Beautiful Desolation is expected to launch in October 2019.
