The Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa (ASA) has ruled that Vodacom’s claim of having the network with the least dropped calls is substantiated. MTN lodged a complaint with the ASA against Vodacom’s television commercials where it claims to have “SA’s best network with the least dropped calls”. According to MTN, Vodacom offers no disclaimer or qualification, but rather a statement that the claims are “*As verified by independent research. T’s&C’s apply”. MTN said its drive tests via ATIO in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban, and Cape Town show that it is currently on par with Vodacom – with a dropped call rate of 0.4%. MTN said research conducted by ICASA showed it had the least dropped calls in Limpopo during April 2016, as well as in the North West during August 2016. Vodacom responded, saying MTN cannot rely on cherry-picked regional data to support its argument – as the claim relates to Vodacom’s network capacity across the country. Vodacom submitted data from ATIO for the period from February 2016 to November 2016, which shows it had fewer dropped calls than MTN for 3G-preferred and 4G-preferred voice calls. The report shows that Vodacom achieved a national average dropped call rate below that of MTN and other mobile operators. “Vodacom achieved an average dropped call rate of 0.35%. This is more than 54% better than the closest competitor, MTN, which achieved an average dropped call rate of 0.77%,” stated the report. Data from P3 showed that Vodacom had achieved an overall dropped call rate of 0.9%, while MTN achieved a dropped call rate of 2.8%. The ASA said the data shows that Vodacom has the network with the lowest percentage of dropped calls.
