The Nexus is a centre for gamers and geeks, and is the new home of AWX and Outer Limits. Occupying a two-story building in Randburg, the Nexus hosts a variety of gaming experiences – including gaming stores, a restaurant, LAN venues, and hardware showcases. “The Nexus is a hub for geek communities, a place where you can pop in, chat to your mates, experience new things, and browse an amazing library of products,” said the Nexus’s Hylton Goodwin. “The Nexus aims to be a one-stop shop for everything geeky, driving community interaction and events.” The centre opened in December and has partnered with a number of gaming brands to create one of the most exciting gaming venues in Johannesburg. The venue offers a great place for gamers to gather and play their favourite titles – online or offline.  The AWX and Outer Limits store takes up a large area and stocks a wide range of gaming products – from graphics cards and PS4 titles, to board games and figurines.    Upstairs, a room devoted to competitive PC gaming contains numerous powerful ITX PCs, BenQ monitors, high-quality peripherals, and bean bags.     A large room is dedicated to tabletop and trading card gaming and general events.   Makers and hobbyists can use MakerBot 3D printers to bring their designs to life.     Acer’s Predator Experience Room shows off the latest gaming hardware from Acer, including the monstrous Predator 21X gaming laptop. The room also has a number of HTC Vive VR headsets.    Using the provided Acer Predator short-throw projector and a Thrustmaster racing set-up, racing enthusiasts can play in the dedicated driving room.    Fans of virtual reality gaming can try out the PlayStation VR headset in the PS4 VR room.     The Xbox room includes eight Xbox One consoles and TVs, perfect for Halo or FIFA 17.    Geeks and gamers can take a break from playing and hit the Nexus Cafe, which inhabits the central courtyard. It serves breakfast, lunch, and fantastic milkshakes.
