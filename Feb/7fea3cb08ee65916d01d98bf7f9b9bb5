Facebook is developing its own app for TV streaming boxes, the Wall Street Journal reports. According to the report, the app is part of an effort by Facebook to make itself a video-first company – allowing it to compete for TV advertising revenue. The company is reportedly talking to media companies about licensing long-form, TV-quality content – including sports and scripted entertainment. This content would be distributed through Facebook’s streaming TV app. Facebook has reportedly been working on improving its video and livestreaming platform since 2014, in order to offer premium advertising options. The company’s TV app could include original, premium content from major studios, using an advertising model similar to its new 15-second mid-roll advertisements for live videos. Facebook’s streaming app is reportedly being developed for various TV set-top boxes, including the Apple TV.
