The City of Johannesburg recently tabled its Integrated Annual Report for the 2015/16 financial year, which showed rampant maladministration under the previous ANC-led government. Mayor Herman Mashaba said the total balance for unauthorised expenditure under the ANC regime in the city reached R3.4 billion. “A shocking lack of attention to financial management practices resulted in a failure to adequately investigate cases of unauthorised, irregular, and fruitless and wasteful expenditure,” said Mashaba. The total balance of irregular expenditure in Johannesburg reached R1.8 billion, due to the contravention of supply chain management procedures under ANC rule. “Disgracefully, unauthorised expenditure identified in previous financial years was not investigated to determine whether a person was liable for the expenditure,” said Mashaba. Mashaba has started to take action, with arrests of allegedly corrupt city officials. “The days of blatant maladministration in the city going unpunished have come to an end.” After the DA took over the country’s major metros and gained access to their finances, it uncovered a slew of corruption and maladministration under the ANC. Tshwane mayor Solly Msimanga unveiled a series of schemes to enrich city officials and irregularities related to the R90-million renovations of the Pretoria City Hall. Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip launched an anti-corruption hotline shortly after he took office, which has already resulted in 38 internal investigations. Below are several of the prominent revelations in former-ANC-led metros which are now governed by the DA.
