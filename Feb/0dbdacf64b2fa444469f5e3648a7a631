President Donald Trump has lost a court bid to revive his travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries. Trump’s executive order banned citizens from the countries from entering the US for 90 days. The order also suspended the admission of all refugees into the US for 120 days, and the Syrian refugee programme. The order was then taken to court and a federal district judge blocked key parts of the ban. This paved the way for thousands of people from “banned countries” to enter the US. Trump appealed the ruling, but a panel of three judges from the US Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the bid. There was no precedent to support this “claimed unreviewability”, which runs “contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy”, said the court. Trump is not giving up, and said on Twitter: “See you in court, the security of our nation is at stake!”
