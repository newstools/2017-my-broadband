Tokyo 2020 has invited the Japanese population to give the Organising Committee obsolete electronic devices so the metal can be used in the production of Olympic medals. The project is aimed at engaging Japan by offering everyone the opportunity to play a role in the Games’ preparations. It also responds to calls for sustainability to be integrated into all aspects of the Games, said Tokyo 2020. The Organising Committee aims to collect 8 tons of metal – 40kg of gold, 4,920kg of silver, and 2,944kg of bronze. After the production process, this will result in 2 tons of metal. This will be enough to produce 5,000 medals.
