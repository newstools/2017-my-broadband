Ripple Network Technology has designed a coin-sized wearable device that acts as a panic button, TechCrunch reported. The company has taken to Kickstarter to fund the device, asking backers to help raise $50,000 to get the product off the ground. It will use a healthcare monitoring system called Tunstall and will be limited to working within the United States. If its button is clicked three times by the user, it calls the nearest emergency services via a Bluetooth connection to your phone. For $49, backers get a Ripple and a 3-month support service subscription. A device and a one-year subscription is priced at $129. The device is set to launch in April 2017.
