New CPUs and GPUs have resulted in portable computers becoming more powerful and efficient while retaining their slim designs. The launch of Nvidia’s Pascal graphics processors mean that gaming laptops can now use full-sized desktop GPUs as opposed to the smaller mobile-class equivalents. Intel’s Kaby Lake mobile processors offer reasonable power efficiency and performance improvements too, despite remaining on the same process node as Skylake chips. This has resulted in a wave of new laptops to suit a variety of needs. We looked at various international reviews and accounted for local pricing and availability in order to determine the best laptops in several categories. The best professional laptops combine good performance with a slim design.   Following the launch of the Nvidia GTX 10-series graphics cards, gaming laptops can now power VR headsets and push out high frame rates in the latest games.   Chromebooks offer great value to connected laptop users who don’t require much onboard processing power.   These monstrous devices cram high-end desktop performance into large, expensive bodies.
