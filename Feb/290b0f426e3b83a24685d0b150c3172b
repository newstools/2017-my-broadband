Parliament’s Joint Committee On Ethics And Members’ Interests has released its Register of Members’ Financial Interests for the past financial year. The purpose of the register is to provide information about any financial interest which a member of parliament has, or any benefit which he or she received. This is done to assess any potential influence on an MP’s actions or words. The register reveals that finance minister Pravin Gordhan received six gifts over the past year, including health soaps and scented candles worth R800 from Naspers chairman Koos Bekker. Gordhan also received a Nestle box of chocolates worth R200 from Nestle, and Johnnie Walker and wine from the Embassy of Palestine. Gordhan has a diversified portfolio of shares, which includes shares in numerous tech companies – as listed in the table below.
