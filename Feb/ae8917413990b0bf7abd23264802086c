Neotel launched its new brand today, which sees the company change its primary colour to blue and adding Liquid Telecom to its logo. In June 2016, Liquid Telecom, the pan-African telecoms group owned by Econet Global, entered into an agreement to acquire Neotel for R6.55 billion. The Competition Commission approved the deal in October, and two months later, Liquid Telecom received approval from ICASA to buy Neotel. Liquid Telecom has now reached final close on the Neotel deal, which saw the company unveil its new brand. “Neotel is now part of the Liquid Telecom Group. This acquisition creates the largest pan-African telecommunications service provider, with the competitive advantage of an unparalleled fibre network footprint across the region and a comprehensive product portfolio,” said the company. This will result in a “compelling value proposition to telecoms operators, enterprises, governments, small and medium businesses, and individual customers,” it said.
