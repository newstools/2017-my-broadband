Billboard and Pandora have announced an exclusive agreement which will add influential Pandora streaming data to the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart. The Hot 100 ranks the week’s most popular songs across all genres, determined by a formula blending track sales, radio airplay, and streaming – as measured by Nielsen Music. In future, the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart will include Pandora’s streaming data. “Pandora will also impact Billboard’s streaming-based charts and Hot 100 formula-based genre rankings,” said Billboard. Pandora data will be incorporated into the Billboard charts from 11 February.
