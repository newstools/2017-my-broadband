Hiring software developers is one of the biggest challenges for companies. Skilled developers get approached a lot, and the demand for developers greatly outweighs the supply. OfferZen has launched the first recruitment marketplace in South Africa, making it much faster and easier for companies to find and hire software developers. More than 300 companies already use OfferZen, including big-name companies like Barclays, GetSmarter, Takealot, Entelect, Superbalist, Allan Gray, and Investec. The marketplace has grown fast, with developers getting placed into a permanent position through OfferZen on a daily basis. Due to its innovative model, OfferZen attracts even those developers who avoid traditional recruiters and job boards. The list of developers looking for their next opportunity is updated weekly, with new developers becoming available for companies to consider and approach. Developers apply to be on OfferZen and only top candidates, actively looking for a new job, are accepted. OfferZen provides companies with important information before they reach out to a developer: where someone is based, where they want to work, what experience they have, what theyâ€™re interested in doing next, what their preferred salary is, and even competing offers from other companies. All developers on OfferZen are actively looking for work, and are responsive when companies contact them. If a developer accepts an interview request from a company, the interview can be scheduled right away with a built-in scheduling tool. The platform also has an in-app messaging system that enables companies and candidates to communicate directly.
