MSI has launched two dual-slot, low-profile Radeon RX 460 graphics cards for small PC builds. The MSI RX 460 2GT LP and RX 460 4GT LP feature 2GB and 4GB of GDDR5 VRAM respectively, and use a dual-fan cooler. The Radeon RX 460 GPU is a budget solution for low-power gaming builds or powerful home theatre PCs, and supports a maximum resolution of 3,840 x 2,160. MSI’s new low-profile cards use “military class 4” components and can be overclocked using MSI Afterburner.
