Mark Zuckerberg shared images of an Oculus Research lab in Redmond in a recent Facebook post, providing a glimpse of the VR technologies the company is developing. Facilities displayed included a new anechoic chamber, a clean room that filters out particles 1,000 times smaller than a speck of dust, and machinery used in the production of VR lenses. Zuckerberg also showed off a glove control prototype for the Oculus Rift, which could allow you to use your hands intuitively in virtual reality applications. “Wearing these gloves, you can draw, type on a virtual keyboard, and even shoot webs like Spider-Man. That’s what I’m doing here,” said Zuckerberg.
