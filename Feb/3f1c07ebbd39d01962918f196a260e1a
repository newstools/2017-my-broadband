If virtual reality turns out to be a complete failure, Valve head Gabe Newell would be fine with the outcome. Speaking to Polygon, Newell said Valve is “comfortable” with the possibility. “We’re optimistic. We think VR is going great. It’s going in a way that’s consistent with our expectations,” he said. “We’re also pretty comfortable with the idea that it will turn out to be a complete failure.” Valve developed the HTC Vive VR system in partnership with HTC and supports VR games on its online PC platform Steam. Newell said there are around 1,300 VR-based applications on Steam, and 30 of those have made more than $250,000 in revenue.
