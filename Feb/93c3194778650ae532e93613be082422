SpaceX has completed a static fire test of one of its Falcon 9 boosters that it landed during a previous mission, Ars Technica reported. The rocket was used to transport cargo to the International Space Station in April 2016. Satellite operator SES will be SpaceX’s first client to use a previously-landed Falcon 9. The rocket will be used to launch the geostationary communications satellite SES-10, which was designed and manufactured by Airbus Defence and Space on the Eurostar E3000 platform, and will be operated by SES.
