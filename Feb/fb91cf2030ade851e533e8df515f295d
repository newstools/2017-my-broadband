Pinnacle has launched a new corporate identity for its two divisions Pinnacle Security Solutions (Pinnsec) and Datanet following on its own brand identity evolution in May 2016. The new futuristic identities feature clean lines of black logos with accents of red for Pinnsec and a fresh green pallet for Datanet that will roll out nationwide February 7th 2017. “Pinnacle believes that a coherent brand portfolio is essential for activating an organisation’s business strategy and easing customer navigation whilst at the same time driving stakeholder understanding. The new brand identities are therefore easily identifiable as part of the Pinnacle stack and compliment the company’s portfolio,” said Pinnacle Managing Director Tim Humphreys-Davies. Both identities better reflect the two separate divisions’ corporate brand and more accordingly reflects its strategy following the renewal of the Pinnacle brand a year ago. It clearly signifies the growth and transformation of Pinnacle’s future whilst celebrating its traditional culture of technology and innovation established over many years of the company’s history. “We’ve retained both the division’s names as that reflects our heritage, but have emphasised the two distinct colour pallets of the visual language to state the growth of the two brands in their separate areas of expertise”, said Humphreys-Davies. “We are proud to be ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving technological industry, and the new Pinnsec and Datanet identity will now illustrate how far we have come and where we are heading in the future,” said Divisional Director: PinnSec / Modrac / Datanet Craig Luck. The changes mark a new chapter for both divisions and represent a fantastic opportunity to embrace the new Pinnacle brand proposition. For more information visit the Pinnacle website.
