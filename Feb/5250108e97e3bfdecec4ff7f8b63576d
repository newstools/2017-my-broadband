Salmonella, the bacterium known for causing food poisoning, may become a weapon in the fight against cancer, a study has found. Ars Technica reported that South Korean researchers have tested a genetically-modified version of the bacterium on mice implanted with human colon cancer. The study was published in Science Translational Medicine. The researchers first disarmed the bacterium so it doesn’t cause disease. They then added Flagellin B, which is known to trigger a powerful immune response in humans. In an experiment with the mice, a control group of seven mice had 91 tumours between them. In a group of eight mice that received the treatment, there were only four tumours between them. The treatment destroyed the cancer in five mice, while three mice had four small tumours in total.
