Cellebrite has announced that it can now unlock most iPhones, including the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. Shahar Tal, director of forensic research at Cellebrite, said the company “now supports lawful unlocking and evidence extraction of iPhone 4S/5/5C/5S/6/6+ devices”. Cyberscoop reported that Cellebrite charges “$1,500 to unlock an individual phone, while a yearly subscription to the service runs for $250,000”. “The company’s newest products also extract and analyse data from a wide range of popular apps, including all of the most popular secure messengers around,” said Cyberscoop. The announcement comes a year after a New York court ruled in Apple’s favour in a case where law enforcement wanted the company to unlock one of its phones.
