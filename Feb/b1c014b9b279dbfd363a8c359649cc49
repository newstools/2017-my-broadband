Telkom mobile subscribers from around South Africa took to social media this morning to complain that the network’s LTE services were not working. Subscribers noticed the outage from 07:00, with reports complaining of degraded performance since Thursday evening. According to feedback from Telkom, the complaints of poor network performance from yesterday evening and the outage this morning are not related. “We had two major cable breaks in the Western Cape this morning, which briefly degraded mobile Internet throughput,” Telkom spokesperson Jacqui O’Sullivan told MyBroadband. Traffic was restored at approximately 09:30. “The break was repaired as quickly as possible to ensure we could get our customers reconnected and operating smoothly. We do apologise for any inconvenience the fault caused.”
