RetroBlox has unveiled its modular gaming console, which features support for retro game cartridges and discs. The console allows gamers to play games by inserting cartridges or discs into modules. After inserting a game into the module, the game can be saved to the user’s collection or played off the cartridge or CD. Hybrid emulation technology is used to provide a smooth gaming experience in 1080p, said the company. The RetroBlox base unit includes an optical disc drive compatible with a number of disc-based console games, including the PSX. RetroBlox also includes online functionality, allowing users to share screenshots and videos to Facebook or Twitter and stream video to YouTube or Twitch. The RetroBlox modular console is set to launch on crowdfunding sites this year.
