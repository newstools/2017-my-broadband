Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has announced an agreement with Daimler, which will see the car manufacturer operate self-driving cars on Uber’s network. “We are incredibly excited by the potential for self-driving cars to further our mission of bringing reliable transportation to everyone, everywhere,” said Kalanick. He said self-driving cars will reduce traffic accidents, free up the space currently used to park the world’s billion-plus cars, and cut congestion. “Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy, because Uber has no experience making cars.” “That’s why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world.” By opening the Uber platform to Daimler, Kalanick said progress will be quicker than working alone.
