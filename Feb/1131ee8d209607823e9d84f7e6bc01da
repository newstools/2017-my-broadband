ShowMax has enabled a 1080p high-definition profile for the DStv Explora decoder, the streaming service told MyBroadband. Where content is available in Full HD, it will stream to subscribers who watch ShowMax on their Explora in 1080p – provided they have not enabled bandwidth limits. The streaming service said making 1080p widely available is on its product roadmap. ShowMax is also looking at offering content in higher framerates, high dynamic range, and at UHD resolutions further down the road. “At the same time, we’re also looking at the other end of things and seeing how we can help mobile users – who make up a significant portion of our base – reduce data consumption and ultimately take data costs out of the equation,” said ShowMax. Update: ShowMax has provided an update on its Explora streaming announcement. “It’s correct to say that ShowMax supplies some content at 1080p to the Explora. The maximum resolution that the Explora currently displays, however, is 1080i, so this is currently the highest resolution at which you can view our content,” said ShowMax.
