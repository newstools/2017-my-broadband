South Africa’s recent credit rating downgrade to junk status by S&P and Fitch increased the risk and uncertainty Vodacom faces, said chief financial officer Till Streichert. During Vodacom’s latest annual results presentation, Streichert said Vodacom is localising as far as possible to deal with potential increased volatility of the rand. Where this is not possible, it contractually fixes currency exchanges or uses forward exchange contracts. Vodacom is also positioned to handle the possibility of reduced consumer spend through its micro bundles and segmented offers, said Streichert. Its debt exposure is mitigated by hedging against exchange rate fluctuation, and fixing conversions at favourable rates, said Streichert. He said that although the rating downgrades have heightened Vodacom’s risk, they have strategies in place to mitigate this risk.
