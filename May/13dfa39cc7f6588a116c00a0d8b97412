Mouse durability is important for gamers, especially if you play high-intensity competitive games such as Dota 2. Strategy games like these favour players with high actions per minute (APM), and competitive gamers can issue an impressive amount of commands in a short space of time. Playing these games over extended periods can affect your hardware, and I have worn out the right-click button on at least one expensive gaming mouse after playing Dota 2 for hundreds of hours. For this reason, gaming mice feature advanced mechanical switches with an endurance rating – which refers to their rated lifetime of clicks. This mouse switch rating is a guideline, and gaming mice regularly outlive or fall short of the expected lifetime. To determine how much gameplay time you can expect to get out of a gaming mouse, we used data collected in 2014 which measured the average APM of StarCraft 2 players. The data found that most players had between 81-100 APM – although this can refer to keystrokes and mouse clicks. We have used the lowest figure in the bracket as an estimated clicks-per-minute figure to minimise the effect of keystroke commands. Using the figure of 81, we estimated how long top-rated gaming mice will last under constant gameplay. Endurance rating: 20 million clicks Gameplay lifetime: 4,115 hours  Endurance rating: 50 million clicks Gameplay lifetime: 10,288 hours  Endurance rating: 30 million clicks Gameplay lifetime: 6,172 hours  Endurance rating: 20 million clicks Gameplay lifetime: 4,115 hours  Endurance rating: 5 million clicks Gameplay lifetime: 1,028 hours  Endurance rating: 20 million clicks Gameplay lifetime: 4,115 hours
