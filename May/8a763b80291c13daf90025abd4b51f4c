The recent spike in the value of Ethereum has made those who invested in the cryptocurrency at the beginning of 2017 a lot of money. If you invested R50,000 in Ethereum on 1 January 2017, your ether would be worth over R1 million today. Ethereum is a decentralised platform which runs smart contracts – applications that run as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. Its ether is one of many cryptocurrencies which are traded on exchanges such as Poloniex, and is not the only one to experience strong growth since the start of 2017. The graphs below show by how much the most-traded cryptocurrencies have gone up in value, based on data from the Poloniex exchange, from 1 January 2017 to today.    Note: Zcash traded at over $1,300 on Poloniex in November 2016, which distorts the “all-time” graph view used for the other cryptocurrencies.
