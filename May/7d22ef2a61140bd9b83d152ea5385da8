Vox has launched Gate Guard, a self-contained access control security solution that allows companies to remotely monitor and manage after hours access to their premises. Says Kobus van Deventer, Nerve Centre manager at Vox, ¨Perpetrators are increasingly gaining access to properties (both residential and business), by lifting gates off of their rails, and entering the premise.  Gate Guard triggers an alarm in our remote monitoring centre, and directly with clients, to alert them to the illegal entry, or unexpected access¨ Real time video, accessible via smartphones, enables users to keep an eye on who is entering or exiting premises, and in the event of a robbery, use the footage to strengthen insurance claims, or legal proceedings. A team of security professionals have created Gate Guard to be self-contained with its own solar power supply, and dual SIM router specifically for 3G connectivity. ¨We have tried to create a solution that overcomes connectivity and power issues, to ensure that customers of all sizes, in locations anywhere in the country, have peace of mind when it comes to their premise access points¨ concludes van Deventer. For business that have a sizeable security contingent, Gate Guard becomes a valuable add-on, rather than replacement of guards and/ or guard houses on-premises.
