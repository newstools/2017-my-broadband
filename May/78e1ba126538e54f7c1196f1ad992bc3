NASA astronauts will perform a spacewalk on 23 May to replace a computer on the International Space Station, Reuters reported. The computer which failed is the multiplexer/demultiplexer, which was installed on 30 March. It is one of two which control major systems belonging to the US on the space station. It is responsible for routing commands to its solar power system, radiators, and cooling loops. Two NASA astronauts, commander Peggy Whitson and flight engineer Jack Fischer, will perform the two-hour spacewalk. The spacewalk will be broadcast live on NASA TV at 14:00 SA time. The webcast will begin at 12:30.
