The first robot cop will join Dubai police on 24 May, with plans to have 25% of its police force made up of robots by 2030. Newsweek reported that the robot officer forms part of Dubai’s plan to be one of the safest cities thanks to technology and robots. “We planned for a security system for the future of the city to tackle future crimes. By 2025, Dubai will be one of the best five cities in the world on security level,” said its police force. CNN reported that the police robot will be “an adapted REEM humanoid robot, and citizens can report crimes to it and kick-start real-life human investigations”. REEM is a full-size humanoid service robot developed by Pal-Robotics, which can be used in a variety of roles. The 1.7m, 100kg robot is fully customisable, and can navigate autonomously.
