EK has launched new water blocks for Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1060, 1070, 1080, 1080 Ti, and Titan X graphics cards. The water blocks are compatible with Founders Edition cards and are used in conjunction with a custom liquid cooling loop to cool the GPU. The blocks cover the full body of a graphics card, cooling all components – including the GPU, VRM, and memory. The top of the blocks are made from acrylic or POM Acetal material, and plexiglass variants include pre-drilled slots for 3mm LEDs. EK’s new water blocks will replace all current blocks offered for Nvidia’s Pascal cards and will be priced at $125.
