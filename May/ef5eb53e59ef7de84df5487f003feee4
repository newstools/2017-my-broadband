AutoTrader has detailed its new Marketplace offering, which it says will “smash online fraud”. The company said online fraud in the car marketplace is a problem, and it has decided to take it on by introducing an “all-round safety solution”. “We’ve tried to create a really simple solution, combining the real world premises and expertise of Bosch Service Stations with our online know-how and finance partners,” said AutoTrader CEO George Mienie. “We now offer customers a safe place to buy and sell their used cars privately with confidence.” The Marketplace offers the following tools to help buyers and sellers: AutoTrader said the “scrutiny of every car for sale and every buyer” removes the dangerous aspects of private car sales. This also ensures that stolen cars are not sold on the private market, and that legitimate car sales comply with the Second-Hand Goods Act. Initial user feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, said the company.
