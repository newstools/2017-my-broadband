Amazon is shutting down its Underground Actually Free programme in its mobile marketplace in 2019. Amazon said that from 31 May, it will no longer accept new app and game submissions for the Underground Actually Free programme. “If you’re an existing Amazon Underground developer, you will continue to get paid for every minute customers spend in your app as provided in our developer agreement,” said Amazon. “You can continue to submit and publish updates to your existing Amazon Underground apps until 2019.” Access to the Underground Actually Free store through Amazon’s Appstore for Android devices will end in later in 2017. Amazon said Android customers will still have access to the store to shop for physical goods and access Prime Video content. They will also be able to enjoy installed Underground Actually Free apps.
