Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger said hackers have gained access to a new Disney movie, and are demanding a ransom. Iger did not name the movie, but speculation is that it may be Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales or Cars 3. According to the Hollywood Reporter, a work print of Star Wars: The Last Jedi is also rumoured to have been pirated and held for ransom. Iger said they refused to pay the ransom and are working with investigators on the issue. This comes shortly after hacker The Dark Overlord posted episodes from the new season of Orange is the New Black to a file sharing website. The hacker threatened to release the episodes unless Netflix paid them a ransom.
