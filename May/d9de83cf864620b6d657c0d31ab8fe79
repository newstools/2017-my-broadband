LG has launched a new 42.5-inch 4K IPS monitor, the LG 43UD79-B. The IPS display features a 3,840×2,160 resolution, a 1000:1 contrast ratio, and 60Hz refresh rate. It also supports AMD’s FreeSync dynamic refresh rate technology. A feature LG punted is the monitor’s ability to display four 21.5-inch Full HD “screens” at once, thanks to multiple inputs (as pictured below), and “On Screen Control” and “Screen Split” functions. The monitor also features two built-in Harman Kardon speakers with a remote control. The unit is expected to sell for $700 in the US.
