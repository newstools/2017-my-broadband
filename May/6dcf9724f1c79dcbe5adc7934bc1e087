Amazon has launched voice calling and messaging features for its Alexa platform. Users will be able to ask Alexa to call any contact with an Amazon Echo device or a smartphone with the Alexa app installed. Users must enable Alexa calling and messaging before they can use the platform to communicate with contacts. In addition to voice calling, users can ask their Alexa-powered device to send a message to a contact – narrating the message. The Alexa Show’s Drop In feature also allows you to begin a video call with contacts who have permitted Drop In access. Alexa calling and messaging will be available to all Alexa users for free.
