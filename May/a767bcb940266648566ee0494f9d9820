At a vibrant, star-studded event in Johannesburg, Huawei launched the P10 in South Africa. The P10 features a 5.1-inch 1080p display, powered by a Kirin 960 chipset, and supports dual-SIM functionality, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage and can expand their storage through a MicroSD card. The hardware is powered by a 3,200mAh battery and uses four antennas to support 4.5G functionality for faster data speeds and a dual-antenna for its Wi-Fi system for better coverage. Huawei has used new “diamond-cutting” technology for the metal body of the P10, which protects the device from scratches and scratch, nor will you leave fingerprint marks on the smartphone when touching it. It features a Leica Dual-Camera 2.0, with a rear 20MP monochrome sensor and a 12MP sensor for colours, and a fingerprint reader and the Android OS with EMUI 5.1 also come standard with the devices. The device will be available in South Africa from Friday 12 May, with the P10 costing R12,999 and the P10 Plus priced at R13,999.
