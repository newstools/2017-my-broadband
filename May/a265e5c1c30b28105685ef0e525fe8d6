Showmax has signed a deal with the Polish mobile network operator Play to supply Showmax to Play’s contract customer base. The transaction will see Showmax reach over eight million subscribers in Poland. Showmax will be provided for 12 months for free to the majority of Play’s postpaid customer base. The remainder will get one month’s access to Showmax. Play has a customer base of 14 million subscribers and a market share of 26%, said Showmax. “The level of interest in Showmax since our launch in Poland earlier this year has exceeded even our most optimistic estimates,” said Showmax CEO John Kotsaftis.
