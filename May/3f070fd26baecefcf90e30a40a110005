Microsoft has launched a new lightweight version of Windows 10, built for simplicity and performance on lower-end machines. Windows 10 S was revealed at the company’s #MicrosoftEDU event and aims to solve problems encountered in education – such as multi-user and educational tools support. The company also said the full Office Suite will soon arrive on the Windows Store. Windows 10 S offers superior performance and security, and can run on a wide range of hardware, said Microsoft. Users can only run applications available on the Windows Store platform, and attempting to run an external application will result in the user being redirected to a similar program on the store. An education administration suite, which includes a built-in wizard for setting up multiple Windows 10 desktops in classrooms, and new education-focussed PCs from Microsoft partners are also part of the drive to get more users on Windows. Windows 10 S will be available on PCs from Microsoft partners and will be free for schools using Windows 10 Pro PCs.
