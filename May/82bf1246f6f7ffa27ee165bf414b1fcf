Pepe the Frog has been killed off by its creator, as reported by The Guardian. The report stated that Matt Furie created the image as part of his “Boy’s Club” series on MySpace in 2005. Pepe became a popular meme, and was adopted by the “alt-right” in the build-up to the 2016 US presidential election. In September 2016, Hillary Clinton said Pepe the Frog was “a racist hate symbol”. Pepe was then added to the Anti-Defamation League’s database of hate symbols. Furie tried to save the image through a “Save Pepe” movement, but has now killed the character in a strip as part of Fantagraphics’ Free Comic Book Day. “It showed Pepe laid to rest in an open casket, being mourned by his fellow characters from Boy’s Club,” stated the report.
