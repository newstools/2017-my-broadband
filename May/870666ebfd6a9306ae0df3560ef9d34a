The Look & Listen at Hillfox Value Centre – the last one in South Africa – will soon close, marking the end of an era. Look & Listen was started nearly 50 years ago by Rob Ziegler, and the first Look & Listen – in Hillbrow – was an iconic music shop for many years. During the height of the LP, cassette deck, and CD era, Look & Listen had numerous stores around the country – but the digital era ate away at its business model. While it is a sad day for music enthusiasts, it comes as no surprise that the franchise is closing down its last outlet. In February 2013, Look & Listen halted its online purchases, and in June 2014, the company was placed under business rescue. At the time, Look & Listen’s Howard Lazarus said the plan was to close stores which were losing money and continue with the better stores. While the short-term strategy saved several stores, the pressure of online music services and piracy was too much for the brick-and-mortar outlet. The Hillfox Look & Listen told MyBroadband that a closing date has not been decided, but it is expected to happen in a “few months”.
