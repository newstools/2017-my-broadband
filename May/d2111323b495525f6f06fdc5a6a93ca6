The Light Phone can receive and make calls, store up to nine numbers, and tell the time – that’s it. The device is the size of a credit card, weighs 38.5g, and is now available for pre-order for $150. The Light Phone sports a Qualcomm 8208 processor, OLED display, a MicroUSB port, support for GSM 850MHz/900MHz and 1,800MHz/1,900MHz bands, and a three-day standby battery life, said its makers. It is designed as a “second phone”, and uses call forwarding from your primary smartphone for incoming calls and will use your existing number for outbound calls. First launched on Kickstarter in 2015, the first batch of Light Phones shipped to clients in January. Current pre-orders are expected to ship in May and are limited to the US.
