New research from the Harvard community found that HTTPS has prevented governments from seeing which page a user is viewing on Wikipedia, which helped fight censorship in numerous countries. This study analysed the scope of government-sponsored censorship of Wikimedia sites around the world. It found that, considering the widespread use of filtering technologies, there was relatively little censorship of Wikipedia. “In fact, our study finds there was less censorship in June 2016 than before Wikipedia’s transition to HTTPS-only content delivery in June 2015,” said the researchers. HTTPS prevents censors from seeing which page on a website a user is viewing, which means censors must choose to either block the entire site or allow access to all pages. The findings suggests that a shift to HTTPS has been good for accessibility to information.
