Amazon has revealed Prime Live Events, a new live entertainment programme for Prime members. The service shows off artists performing in iconic locations, and Prime Live Events will be filmed and made available on Prime Video internationally. The first Prime Live Event takes place on 23 May, with Blondie performing a mix of their greatest hits and new material. Blondie will play in front of 750 fans at the Round Chapel in Hackney. The Prime Live Events schedule for June and July includes Alison Moyet playing at the same venue. “We want to offer Prime members the best live entertainment experience ever,” said Geraldine Wilson, General Manager of Amazon Tickets.
