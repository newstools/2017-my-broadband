Virgin Galactic has successfully tested the VSS Unity’s “feather” re-entry system in flight for the first time. The VSS Unity is a SpaceShipTwo-class suborbital rocket-powered manned plane, which was rolled out on 19 February 2016. The re-entry system which was tested involved the VSS Unity folding up its tail boom to improve stability when it re-entered the earth’s atmosphere. The test flight was conducted from the Mojave Air and Space Port, with the VSS Unity piloted by Mark Stucky and Mike Masucci. The flight was the fourth glide flight and the eighth flight overall of the VSS Unity.
