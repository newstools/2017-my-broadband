Point Topic has released its latest residential broadband tariffs and bandwidth report, which shows that South Africa has slow and expensive fixed broadband services. Point Topic’s scorecard compares the entry-level, median, and average residential broadband tariffs in 83 countries. The data includes fixed broadband services offered over copper, cable, and fibre networks. “To help provide an easy way of comparing directly, we have taken the PPP data on entry-level, median, and average broadband tariffs, produced rankings, and then compared the variance,” stated the report. Iran boasts the lowest broadband prices, followed by Ukraine, Russia, Romania, and Japan. South Africa ranks 66 out of 83 countries for median broadband pricing, and at number 71 for average broadband pricing. One positive is the entry-level broadband pricing in South Africa, where we rank at number 14. Point Topic’s broadband tariff country scorecard is below. Countries at the top offer the lowest median tariffs.  Point Topic also ranked countries by the average advertised download speed offered to residential customers. To put this indicator into context, Point Topic included a column for average price per Mbps of bandwidth. The results show that South Africa has a low average advertised download speed, and a high price-per-Mbps when compared to its peers.
