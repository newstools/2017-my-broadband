AlphaGo, the AI from Google’s DeepMind division, has defeated Ke Jie in their first Go match in China. Ars Technica reported that Ke Jie, considered the best Go player in the world, lost by half a point – the closest margin possible in Go. However, it noted that checking the score difference against AlphaGo is misleading. The AI doesn’t try to thrash you, it charts the surest course to victory and follows it, even if it is by a tiny margin. This is not the first time AlphaGo and Jie have faced one another. The AI beat the Go world champion in a series of matches earlier this year. The co-founder of DeepMind, Demis Hassabis, said Ke Jie tried to use AlphaGo’s own moves against it this time, but it didn’t work out.
