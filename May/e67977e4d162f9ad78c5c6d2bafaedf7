Nvidia has announced the launch of its GeForce MX150 Pascal-powered mobile graphics chip. The MX150 GPU provides power-efficient graphics performance for lightweight laptops, offering enough processing power for photo and video editing in addition to light gaming. The chip is a major upgrade to the previous-generation GeForce GTX 940MX mobile chip, offering three times the performance-per-watt. Nvidia said laptops equipped with its GeForce MX150 chip will offer up to four times the gaming performance of devices using integrated graphics. Laptops using a GeForce MX150 chip will be able to run popular eSports titles like Dota 2, CS: GO, and League of Legends at 1080p with a framerate of 60fps. The new chip also supports Nvidia Optimus and GPU Boost, which allows the GPU to dynamically scale its performance to improve battery life. Laptops equipped with Nvidiaâ€™s new GeForce MX150 mobile GPU will begin shipping internationally in June 2017.
