Linux founder Linus Torvalds has announced that the final release of Linux kernel 4.11 is now available. “So after that extra week with an rc8, things were pretty calm, and I’m much happier releasing a final 4.11 now,” said Torvalds. “We still had various smaller fixes the last week, but nothing that made me go hmmm.” Linux kernel 4.11 is a major update to the operating system, with many improvements and new features. The update includes driver improvements, arch updates, generic networking, and filesystem fixes.
