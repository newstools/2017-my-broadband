Reports that the MP3 is dead have missed the real story, according to software developer Marco Arment. Based on the announcement by the Fraunhofer IIS, you may think the MP3 file format has been written off and that everyone should move to AAC, said Arment. However, what has really happened is that the last MP3 patents have expired. Fraunhofer’s announcement was about ending its patent-licensing programme, and advocating that everyone moves to AAC, a newer format that it argues is better and is still patented. “MP3 is supported by everything, everywhere, and is now patent-free,” said Arment. There is no reason we shouldn’t continue using it, he said.
