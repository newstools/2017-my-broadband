Backblaze – a backup solutions provider – has released its hard drive reliability statistics for the first quarter of 2017. It compared hard drives from multiple manufacturers: Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba, and HGST. Reliability was measured in an annualized failure rate, calculated using the number of drive failures relative to the total number of drives. Backblaze recorded the failure rates of its hard drives over Q1 2017, along with the drives’ lifetime reliability based on their failure rates since April 2013. The failure rates for hard drives from 1 January to 31 March 2017 are below. The annualized failure rates for each hard drive using data collected since 2013 are detailed below.
