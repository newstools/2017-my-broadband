The user interface for Google’s new Fuchsia OS was spotted in the latest build of the operating system by Hotfixit.net. Called Armadillo, the UI can be seen if you build and run Fuchsia for Android. Ars Technica reported that the interface and apps are written in Google’s Flutter SDK, which produces cross-platform code. It should therefore be possible to run it on Android and iOS. The home screen is a vertical-scrolling list. In the centre, you’ll see the date, the name of a city, a battery icon, and a profile picture. Above this is a collection of recent apps. Below is a list of suggestions reminiscent of Google Now. Fuchsia first emerged in August 2016, with reports suggesting that Google was building a realtime OS for “Internet of Things” applications and devices – such as car dashboard systems. Current reports speculate that Fuchsia may be a replacement for Android, but Google has not revealed its plans for the OS. Fuchsia does not run on the Linux kernel, and uses “Magenta” – a kernel based on the LittleKernel project. Magenta’s documentation describes it as targeting “modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors”.
