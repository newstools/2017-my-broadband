Google has made it easier to download pages using Chrome on Android, following the introduction of the feature last year. Firstly, you can now press on a link and select “Download link.” This feature is also available when you press an article suggestion on a new tab page. When Chrome is offline, you’ll see a “Download Page Later” button – which lets you download the page when you get back online. Google is also making it easier to access the content you’ve downloaded. When you open a new tab, you will see articles that you’ve downloaded are tagged with an offline badge. “We will also show a list of your recent downloads right on the page for easy access,” said Google.
