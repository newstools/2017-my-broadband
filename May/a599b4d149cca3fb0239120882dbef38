Vodacom has partnered with YouTube to launch YouTube Smart Offline. The service allows Vodacom Android customers to schedule videos for download between midnight and 05:00. Vodacom said customers using YouTube Smart Offline can save on data costs by purchasing a Vodacom Night Owl Data Bundle and downloading videos overnight. Using YouTube Smart Offline, customers do not need to worry about buffering and extra data charges, said Vodacom. The content which customers download is available to watch for 48 hours. The service is currently available to prepaid and hybrid customers, with contract bundles expected to launch in the coming months.
