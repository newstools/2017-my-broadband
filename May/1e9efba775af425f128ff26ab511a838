Intel has released a firmware upgrade which will patch a reported security hole in certain systems. The security flaw has been in enterprise PCs for almost a decade, according to reports. Intel said the vulnerability can be found in Active Management Technology, Standard Manageability, and Small Business Technology. The remotely-executable security hole stretched across multiple generations of Intel platforms. “This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs,” said Intel.
