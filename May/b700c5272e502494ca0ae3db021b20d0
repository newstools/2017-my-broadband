SqwidNet’s IoT network has achieved 38% population coverage in South Africa, which will grow to 85% within the next year. SqwidNet was launched in November 2016, deploying an ultra-narrowband IoT radio network in South Africa. The network enables low-cost, low-power, and secure connectivity for IoT data transmission upon which IoT devices, platforms, applications, and solutions can be developed. SqwidNet coverage now spans eight metropolitan areas – Buffalo City, Nelson Mandela Bay, eThekwini, Mangaung, Ekurhuleni, Tshwane, the City of Johannesburg, and the City of Cape Town. The network is being expanded to cover all national roads, as SqwidNet focuses on providing solutions to utilities, transport and logistics, security, supply chain, and retail services. “IoT applications will reshape business processes and operating models, and have the potential to reduce business risk,” said Reshaad Sha, Chief Executive Officer of SqwidNet. “We are deploying a network that makes it possible for any industry to connect things, create value, and ultimately enable innovation.”
