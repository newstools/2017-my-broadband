Point Topic has released its latest global broadband subscriber report, which shows that the share of copper-based technologies (DSL, ADSL, and ADSL2+) continues to fall in all regions, except Africa. In Q4 2016, the fall of copperâ€™s broadband market share was notable in the Oceania region, where fibre-to-the-home started to gain more ground. Overall, the share of FTTH connections in total fixed broadband subscriber numbers continues to increase. In terms of the annual changes, the number of copper lines globally fell by 10.1%, while FTTH connections increased by 56.3% between Q4 2015 and Q4 2016. These figures are less dramatic when compared to the previous quarter, but the trend of copper to fibre substitution remains prominent. The charts below show broadband technology market share by region and the annual growth in broadband technology subscriber numbers.
