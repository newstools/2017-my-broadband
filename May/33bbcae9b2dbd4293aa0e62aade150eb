The latest MyBroadband Speed Test results show that the new WBS LTE-A network in Gauteng and Cape Town provides an average downlink speed higher than 60Mbps. Multisource is rolling out a national LTE-A network, using WBS towers and infrastructure, in combination with a lease agreement with Vodacom to share infrastructure. On 15 May, Vodacom CEO Shameel Joosub said they are already using the new LTE-A network being built by Multisource. Joosub said the network gives Vodacom room to manoeuvre while the government’s National Integrated ICT Policy White Paper is being discussed. More importantly, it gives Vodacom access to additional network capacity while SA’s migration to digital TV fails to take off, and high-demand 4G spectrum remains unassigned. According to the latest Speed Test App results, the new Multisource network produces impressive results. Download speeds on the network ranged between 46Mbps and 96Mbps, with an average performance of 65Mbps. Upload speeds and latency were equally impressive, with averages of 34Mbps and 23ms to a Johannesburg server. While these speeds are an indication of a good network, the real test will only come when more traffic is taken on. The Multisource LTE-A network is currently only open to a small number of users, which will change when the network is opened to all Multisource and Vodacom subscribers.
