Instagram has added support for augmented reality face filters to its Android and iOS apps. A selection of eight face filters are available and can be accessed by tapping the new face icon in the bottom-right corner. Certain face filters work for two or more people and the filters are compatible with Instagram’s Boomerang feature. Other new features include the ability to create videos that play in reverse and add hashtag stickers to shared images. The updates are available as part of Instagram version 10.21 for iOS and Android.
