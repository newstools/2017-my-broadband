Nokia’s new 3310 went on sale in the UK this week, and sold out straight away. The Register reported that Nokia is struggling to meet consumer demand for the phone, 17 years after the original 3310 went on sale. “We have been working with our partners and can confirm the 3310 will be available again soon – we’ll confirm the details as soon as possible,” stated Nokia Mobile. The 3310 is selling for £50 in the UK, with reports stating that new stock should arrive within two weeks.
