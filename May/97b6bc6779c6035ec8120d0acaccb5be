The Deputy Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, has presented the department’s annual performance plan in parliament. Its focus areas include broadband connectivity and the implementation of the Integrated ICT Policy White Paper. The broadband plans hit a roadblock when SITA, in collaboration with the department, issued a tender to procure broadband services in 2016. It was subsequently cancelled due to bidders “not meeting the technical specifications”. “The Department is currently reviewing different procurement options which would include utilisation of… ICT state-owned companies,” said Ndabeni-Abrahams. “The Department has therefore in 2017/18 committed to project managing the roll-out of the broadband connectivity Implementation Plan towards connecting 2,700 sites.” Ndabeni-Abrahams said they have also started promulgating legislation which will enable the implementation of the Integrated ICT Policy White Paper. The White Paper was approved by Cabinet in 2016, but drew criticism from mobile operators over its proposed wholesale access network and its distribution of high-demand frequency spectrum. Ndabeni-Abrahams said that for the 2017/18 period, the department has prioritised legislation to implement the White Paper. Bills will be drafted and submitted to Cabinet for public consultation approval, she said.
