Asus ROG has unveiled its Zephyrus gaming laptop, which uses Nvidia’s Max-Q design technology to cram a full GeForce GTX 1080 into a 16.9mm-thick chassis. The Zephyrus is the world’s thinnest gaming laptop equipped with an Intel 7th-gen processor and GeForce GTX 1080 card. The 15.6-inch laptop boasts a FHD display with 100% sRGB colour gamut, along with G-Sync and a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz. To cool the powerful hardware inside, Asus has implemented an active cooling system which features airflow vents in the bottom of the chassis that open along the laptop’s hinge. Other features include a keyboard with Aura RGB lighting and a right-mounted touchpad which doubles as a number pad. There is currently no pricing or release date for the Asus ROG Zephyrus.
