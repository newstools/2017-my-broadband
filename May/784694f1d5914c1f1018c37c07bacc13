The Netis 300Mbps Wireless N Range Extender E1+ is designed to establish a highly efficient mobile office or entertainment network with wider coverage. E1+ works as a “Range Extender” in default, which will pick up the wireless signal from your main router and expand it to where your main router may not reach. For the price and the flexibility, this little unit is a great solution if you want to improve connectivity across your house. If for instance, your main router device is at the extreme west corner of your house and the far east corner never gets good connectivity, you can install this router just outside the far east room to help restore the same connectivity across your house. The router can be connected to 3 devices simultaneously, and given that one is wired into ethernet jack, it should – be very stable. The router syncs to the main modem easily using WPS making the setup fairly simple. To set it up, you can press the WPS button on the main router and then press and hold the WPS/main button on this router. Within a couple of seconds, it will detect and connect to your router and maintain a solid blue light. It also comes with detailed instructions if required, attaching an unboxing video and few sample images. The router may take a few minutes to pop-up on a smart device; however you should be able to enjoy a full signal once it is connected. The device is recommended for light internet usage in previously dead areas and won’t necessarily give you the fastest connectivity, but it works great for Facebook, email and YouTube browsing. The device is a fairly compact and portable making it an ideal choice for travellers, students, or anyone else for work or play, with an RRP of R320.
