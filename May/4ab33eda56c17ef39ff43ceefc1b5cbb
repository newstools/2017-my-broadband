Google has added support for an experimental night mode to the Canary build of Chrome OS. Users on Reddit discovered the Night Light toggle in the taskbar settings of the operating system. This feature functions similarly to the night mode in Windows, giving the display a warm, orange hue when activated. This results in reduced levels of blue light, which can interfere with sleep patterns and cause eye strain â€“ especially when viewed at night. Users will need to switch to the experimental Chrome OS Canary build in order to use the Night Light feature. The feature is expected to roll out to standard Chrome OS builds in the future.
