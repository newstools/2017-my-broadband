Opera has unveiled its Neon concept browser for Windows, which the company said “wipes away your desktop clutter by bringing your computer’s wallpaper into the browser”. Opera Neon’s new physics engine means tabs and other objects respond to you like real objects – they have weight and move in a natural way when dragged, pushed, or popped. The browser offers video pop-out, a split screen mode, a rebuilt omnibox, and improved visual tabs. Users can also collect images into the built-in snap-to-gallery tool and gather their media-playing tabs in the player panel. The video below provides an overview of Opera’s new Neon concept browser.
