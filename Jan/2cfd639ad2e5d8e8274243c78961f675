With the recently-released Firefox 51 and the forthcoming Chrome 56, Mozilla and Google have started labelling web pages with forms delivered over HTTP as unsecure. Pages with password fields will be explicitly labelled as unsecure. Chrome will also mark pages that request credit card information over HTTP as unsecure. The warnings will be placed in the address bar, with Chrome using the wording “Not Secure” to ward off users. This is part of a push to get more sites to adopt HTTP with transport layer security, called HTTPS. Firefox is also set to include a warning next to the password box whenever a page is delivered over HTTP. The latest version of the browser features a struck-through padlock icon on every page delivered over HTTP.
