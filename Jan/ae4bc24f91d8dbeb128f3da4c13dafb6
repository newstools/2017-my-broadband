Microsoft’s HoloLens commercial lead Roger Walkden said the headset is not selling well, but the company will continue developing the technology. HoloLens is a see-through display you wear on your head which creates holograms in the real world. HoloLens supports holograms natively without markers or external cameras, and it does not require wires, a phone, or a connection to a PC. The Microsoft HoloLens Development Edition costs $3,000, while the Commercial Suite is priced at $5,000. Walkden told The Inquirer that the company is selling “thousands” of HoloLens devices, which they are happy with. He said there is a roadmap for the device and that consumers can expect more affordable versions in the future. “Just remember this is version one, and there will be future versions,” said Walkden.
