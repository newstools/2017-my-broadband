Google will release a Pixel 2 smartphone which includes features not present in the first device – including waterproofing – according to a report from 9to5Google. The report stated that Google will also focus on improving the device’s camera, which was a standout feature of the Pixel when it released in 2016. Other new features will include improved chipsets, while a range of lower-end, cheaper Pixel devices are also reported to be in the works. The report stated that the improved Pixel 2 will have “at least a $50 price increase” compared to the original Pixel – which retails for $649 in the US. No launch date was confirmed.
