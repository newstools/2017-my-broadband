Car accident victim Julio Ceja is suing Apple after an iPhone owner who was texting and driving rear-ended him, Ars Technica reported. Ceja does not want monetary compensation, but demands sales of the iPhone be banned in California until Apple has rolled out technology that prevents you from texting while driving. In his lawsuit, Ceja claims that Apple has had a lock-out feature since 2008 and was granted a patent on it in 2014. He said the reason Apple hasn’t built the technology into its devices is because it would lose “valuable market share”. “Apple refuses to employ the technology, choosing instead to allow the massive carnage to occur,” said Ceja.
