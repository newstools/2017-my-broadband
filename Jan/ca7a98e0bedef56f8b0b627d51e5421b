Intel recently revealed its 7th-generation processor lineup for desktop PCs, with power-saving chips and high-performance unlocked CPUs put on display. The Kaby Lake processors bring a number of changes to Intel’s traditional CPU lineup, including low-TDP models of most chips and Pentium processors with Hyper-Threading. 7th-gen Intel desktop processors are available in South Africa, although certain chips have not released locally yet. Intel has branded several processor models with a “T” suffix in order to show that the chip is a special, low-TDP model – which has been under-clocked in order to use less power. The majority of these low-TDP models are currently not available from South African retailers, including Rebel Tech, Wootware, and Evetech. Below is a pricing overview of the Intel 7th-gen desktop processors available from these stores.
