Tesla plans to power its Gigafactory in Nevada with the world’s largest solar roof installation – a 70-megawatt farm. According to a report by Electrek, the solar installation will be seven-times larger than the next-biggest rooftop setup. Tesla wants the Gigafactory to receive the majority of its power from the solar array, with no fossil fuels to be used by the company. Excess power generated by the panels will be stored by Tesla and used at times when energy is needed. The company also plans to use a closed-loop water system in its battery-making factory, which reduces fresh water usage by 80% compared to the standard process.
