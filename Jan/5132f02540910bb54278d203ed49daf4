Tesla is suing its former director of Autopilot Programs, Sterling Anderson, for breach of contract. According to CNBC, the suit alleges that Anderson “took proprietary information about the Autopilot program and recruited fellow Tesla employees to work with him at another autonomous driving company”. The lawsuit states that Anderson and former head of Google’s autonomous car project, Chris Urmson, were attempting to start the autonomous driving company Aurora together. Aurora responded to the Tesla lawsuit, saying it is without merit and is an abuse of the legal system. “Tesla’s meritless lawsuit reveals both a startling paranoia and an unhealthy fear of competition,” said Aurora. “This abuse of the legal system is a malicious attempt to stifle a competitor and destroy personal reputations.” Aurora said it is looking forward to disproving the false allegations in court.
