Microsoft is adding a power slider to select Windows 10 devices. “We are conducting experiments on features which help improve battery life for Windows devices,” said Microsoft engineer Dona Sarkar. “In a continuation of our battery life work for the Windows 10 Creators Update, some of you will start seeing a new slider in the power flyout on the Taskbar in this build.” Sarkar said the slider does not set new power or performance configurations currently. At this stage, it is only part of the UI. “In this Insider build, we’re just looking to get your feedback on this UI.” Microsoft will work with OEMs to determine the best settings for their customers, so that they can ship those on new Windows 10 PCs. Here is what users can currently expect from this UI: “While this is just one piece of UI, we’ll be talking more about battery life investments in the Windows 10 Creators Update in a few weeks.”
