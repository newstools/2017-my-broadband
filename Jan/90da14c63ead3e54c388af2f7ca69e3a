The DA has called for a public hearing regarding the status of the migration from analogue to digital broadcasting. The party requested a two-day public hearing for stakeholders in the ICT sector to evaluate the status of the Broadcast Digital Migration programme. The programme has been hit by multiple delays and scandals, including failing to meet the International Telecommunications Union’s deadline for the worldwide switch off of analogue broadcasting of 15 June 2015. Legal battles over a policy revision are contributing to the delay, in combination with multiple missed targets set by the government. The Constitutional Court will hear these arguments on 21 February 2017. Switching to digital broadcasting from analogue will free up spectrum for mobile broadband use, which mobile operators have been calling for. The DA said it aims to find a solution to the slow migration process during the requested hearings.
