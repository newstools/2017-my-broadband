NASA has published its Images of Change collection, which shows how the earth has changed over the past 30 years. Each entry consists of two images which show a before-and-after picture of the earth’s geography up to three decades apart. The images include everything from glacier melting to natural disasters, and show the effect natural and human events can have on the planet. Check out the best comparisons below. (Click on the images to view them in full size.) The amount of old, thick ice in the Arctic Sea has declined dramatically over the past three decades. The blue-gray ice pictured is thinner and younger than the older white ice. These pictures were taken during the same season, 32 years apart.  China finished building the world’s largest hydroelectric plant, the Three Gorges Dam, on the Yangtze River in 2012. The dam forced 1.2 million people to relocate and drastically changed the flow of the river.  In December 2011, a volcano erupted in the Red Sea and created a new island.  The Ganges River experienced heavy flooding during monsoon rains in 2016, affecting over six million people. NASA’s Earth Observatory captured these images of the Ganges before and after the event.  NASA captured the rapid growth of India’s capital in two images taken 25 years apart. In this time, Delhi’s population grew from 9.4 million to 25 million.  Construction on Dubai’s artificial islands began in 2001 and is still underway. The islands add 231 kilometres to Dubai’s shoreline.  Wax Lake Outlet is an artificial channel built on the Atchafalaya River in Louisiana. The delta plain in Atchafalaya Bay is growing by around 2.8 square kilometres per year due to sediment redistribution.
