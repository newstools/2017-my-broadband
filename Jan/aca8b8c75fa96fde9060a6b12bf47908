Pan-African telecom enabler, SEACOM, has earned the Carrier Ethernet 2.0 certification for services from the Metro Ethernet Forum, an industry association that provides a global services framework and the foundation for service innovation in the telecoms industry. The MEF Certification Programme enables service providers to certify that their Carrier Ethernet services comply with the relevant MEF specifications. It assures SEACOM wholesale and commercial customers that the operator’s network services conform to MEF’s exacting standards of quality and performance. SEACOM was certified for all four MEF service types in November 2016. These include E-Line, E-LAN, E-Tree and E-Access. Only a handful of carriers in Africa have received this certification, and SEACOM is one of the few to have achieved the certification across a full suite of services. Worldwide, more than 200 MEF certified service products have been deployed by more than 70 service providers using around 500 certified products from 80 equipment manufacturers. Says Mark Tinka, SEACOM’s Head of Engineering: “We are delighted to have received this certificate confirming that our Ethernet capabilities will meet the strictest requirements of the large enterprise clients and our wholesale service provider customers. “SEACOM offers the largest African MPLS backbone and our Ethernet services deliver high-quality connectivity with industry-leading PoP-to-PoP service level agreements.” SEACOM’s Ethernet Service provides flexible point-to-point and point-to-multipoint EoMPLS connectivity between major African and International interconnection points. Investment in metro connectivity together with partnerships with leading regional service providers enable SEACOM to deliver services directly into customer premises across Africa and the globe.
