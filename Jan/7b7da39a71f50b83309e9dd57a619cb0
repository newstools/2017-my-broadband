Google has sped up page reloads in Chrome, with reloading sites now said to be 28% faster. According to a report by TechCrunch, Google worked with Facebook and Mozilla (Firefox) to make the page reloads faster. Google has simplified Chrome’s reload behaviour to only “validate the main resource” when reloading a page – avoiding “hundreds of network requests” to check if resources first cached are still valid. Facebook said its pages now load 28% faster on the web.
