Citing several sources, The Guardian has revealed details of the highly-anticipated Samsung Galaxy S8. The report includes information on two forthcoming flagship models, displays, size, and iris scanners. The Guardian also reported that the devices will be announced at the end of March and launched in April. The two devices are code-named the Dream and Dream 2, and both feature displays curved down on the left and right – similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge. The devices will have similar dimensions to their predecessors, but Samsung will increase the effective display size by decreasing the width of the bezel. According to the report, the devices will include iris scanning technology which was set to be installed in the Galaxy Note 7. The sources also confirmed that the Galaxy S8 range will feature an artificial intelligence assistant, potentially called “Bixby”. The cameras on the S8 will have incremental improvements over previous models, in addition to other improvements in specifications. The report did not confirm which chip the device would run on, but stated it would be built on new 10 nanometre technology. Qualcomm’s recently-revealed Snapdragon 835, a chip being built using Samsung’s 10nm processes, may be a contender. The new phones will come with 64GB of internal storage and support microSD cards. They will also feature a USB-C port, stated the report.
