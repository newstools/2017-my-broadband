iBurst has informed customers that it will start decommissioning its network from the beginning of February. “From the beginning of February, iBurst will begin decommissioning their wireless Internet network,” said the company. “In order to ensure your uninterrupted Internet connectivity, we are offering a superior LTE alternative with significantly faster speeds, better coverage, and enhanced reliability.” iBurst previously stated that the “migration specials” include a 100GB per month LTE-A contract priced at R599. The LTE-Advanced network replacing the existing iBurst network is part of a move by Multisource – which acquired iBurst parent WBS in 2015 – to create a new LTE-A national network. “While our nationwide iBurst network has been providing South Africans with affordable bandwidth and connectivity for well over a decade, it has become increasingly outdated in terms of comparable connectivity services now available on the market,” said iBurst in December. “As the new LTE-A network is rolled out, your managed migration will be as disruption-free as possible.” The new LTE-A network from WBS will consist of its own towers and infrastructure, in combination with a lease agreement with Vodacom to share its network infrastructure. The planned network will consist of 10,000 towers by 2020, said WBS.
