The cutting-edge nature of NASA’s research and design has resulted in many new technologies and inventions we use today. Many of the organisation’s space inventions find their way into your home over time, with the consumer versions of NASA inventions called “spinoffs”. These “spinoffs” are regularly covered in NASA’s Spinoff publication, and we have featured eight of them below. If you enjoy sleeping on a memory foam mattress, thank NASA. The agency initially developed memory foam to keep test pilots cushioned during flights.  Shock-absorbing athletic shoes are based on a technology NASA used in the boots of astronauts. This assisted astronauts in conducting EVAs and walking on the moon.  The first practical Fresnel lense solar panels were developed in partnership with NASA and used on various spacecraft for power generation.  NASA created a strong translucent ceramic material which is now used in invisible braces.  Scratch-resistant lenses for glasses are a result of NASA research and design. NASA’s proprietary technology was used to create the consumer scratch-resistant coating.  Portable power devices such as the Dustbuster were made more efficient thanks to a partnership with NASA and the use of the agency’s specially-developed computer programs.  CMOS image sensors are common in devices such as GoPro cameras and mobile phones. NASA developed the technology to capture high-definition images using a small device.  NASA discovered a natural fatty acid when developing life support for its manned Mars mission. Over 90% of baby formula on the market now includes this ingredient.
