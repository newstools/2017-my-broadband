Kagiso Interactive’s claim of being “Undeniably #1 for app development” was challenged recently by Jonathan Sean, who took the company to the Advertising Standards Authority of SA over its advertising. Sean said the advertising, which appeared on the company’s website, was not substantiated and that there is no recognised vote for the best app development agency in South Africa. The advertising included the lines: Kagiso Interactive stated that it had research and awards which showed it was the best at app development in Africa. “It submitted emails from the publications editor and awards executive of Corporate Vision and from Frost & Sullivan,” stated the ASA. A letter from CV Magazine also states that “Kagiso Interactive has been voted and rated: Best Mobile Application Development Company 2016 – Africa”. “Given the notifications from both CV Magazine and Frost & Sullivan, it appears that the respondent’s advertising claims are valid,” said the ASA. The complaint was dismissed.
