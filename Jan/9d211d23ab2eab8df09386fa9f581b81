Nintendo has revealed the pricing and release date of its new Switch gaming console. The Nintendo Switch will launch worldwide on 3 March 2017 and is priced at $299. A game collection called 1-2 Switch will launch alongside the console and will include various mini-games which show off the features of the Nintendo Switch’s controllers. The Switch features two detachable controllers on either side of its portable display, and these controllers can be transferred to a more traditional controller mount when the console is connected to a TV. The battery life of the Nintendo Switch can range from 2-6 hours in its “portable mode” depending on which games it is running. Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will release alongside the console on 3 March 2017.
