The Broadcast Research Council of South Africa (BRCSA) has released its television audience measurements for December 2016. Included in the report is a list of the most-watched shows on SABC 1,2,3, Etv, and DStv. The BRCSA said the report does not “in any way give you a total viewership of DStv Commercial channels”, and that the figures indicated “viewership on the platform at the top tier”. The table below details the most-watched shows in South Africa.
