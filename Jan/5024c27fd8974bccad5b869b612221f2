The Tesla Racing Channel has shown a Tesla P100D with Ludicrous Mode accelerating from 0-60mph (97km/h) in 2.389 seconds – beating Faraday Future’s recent claim that its FF 91 SUV will be the fastest-accelerating production vehicle to date. Faraday Future said its SUV will go from 0-60mph in 2.39 seconds. As shown in the video below, the Tesla makes the run on a drag strip while racing against other cars. Tesla founder Elon Musk recently stated that he thinks a production Tesla will be able to do 0-60 in under 2.35 seconds.
