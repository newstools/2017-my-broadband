Statistics South Africa has announced changes to the way it calculates the country’s consumer price index (CPI). The new basket used to calculate inflation contains 412 products and services, up from 396. Using data from the Living Conditions Survey and other sources, Stats SA said it identifies products and services that households spend the most money on and these form the basket of goods. This basket is updated every four years to remain relevant, which Stats SA said keeps within the five-year norm of international best practice. Products removed from the basket included blank DVDs and CDs, DVDs with content on them, and postage stamps. Tennis balls, teapots, electric fans, automated pool cleaners, cream style sweet corn, tinned peas, spreads such as Marmite and Bovril, theatre fees in public hospitals, and board games were also removed. A number of convenience foods entered the basket, such as frozen food products, instant noodles, and ready-mix flour. Savoury biscuits and rusks also appear for the first time. Sectional title levies were added, along with video games, car rentals, car wash and valets, chicken giblets, beef offal, peanuts, pears, chewing gum, diesel, and toasters.
