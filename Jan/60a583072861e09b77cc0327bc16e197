The Selfly camera drone is an autonomous drone which snaps to the back of your smartphone. Users can store the drone by clipping it onto the back of their smartphone, thanks to a case design which is compatible with 4-6-inch mobile devices. Selfly uses stabilisation technology to function as an autonomous flying camera which can be controlled using your smartphone or left to hover and capture images from a predetermined location. Users can control the drone using their phone’s gravity sensor and pilot the device from a first-person perspective. The Selfly drone includes Wi-Fi communication, 5-minute flight time, and an 8MP camera which captures 1080p video at 30FPS. Selfly is compatible with Android and iOS devices. The device recently launched on Kickstarter and has raised over $70,000 of its $125,000 crowdfunding goal.
