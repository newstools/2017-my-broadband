Point Topic’s Trends in Global Broadband Subscribers report for Q3 2016 shows that China is driving fixed-broadband adoption. The report showed that over 70% of all net adds in fixed-broadband subscribers came from East Asia in the quarter. “The number of copper lines globally fell by 11.6%, while FTTH connections increased by 76.9% between Q3 2015 and Q3 2016,” said Point Topic. China was the strongest performer, and in the six months ending September 2016, the country added nearly 41 million FTTH connections. This was 89% of all FTTH net additions globally. The graph below shows net broadband additions by country for Q3 2016.  In terms of total fixed-broadband subscribers, China retained its top spot – with close to 300 million customers. “As before, France faces competition from the Russian Federation and United Kingdom for the fifth position in the rating. China passed a quarter of a billion fixed-broadband subscriber milestone in Q1 2016 and continues to grow at impressive speed,” said Point Topic.
