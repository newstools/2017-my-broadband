Snapchat, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Dropbox – what do these tech titans all have in common? Each of these high-profile organizations has been exposed in the past year to large scale data breaches, resulting in widespread leaks of employee and customer data. The question seems no longer about whether our information could be shared, but instead, when it will happen. More-so than ever, we as internet citizens are being forced to take the privacy and security of our data into our own hands. Forward-thinking networking solutions provider DrayTek has identified the need for home and business internet users to protect not only their own data, but also that of their employees, customers and families. To help ensure your privacy, DrayTek’s latest update to the award-winning Vigor2860 series router includes the integration of Zenmate’s VPN suite. At the tap of a button within your DrayTek router web interface, Zenmate’s VPN suite allows your network to go from completely exposed to fully protected. Using the Zenmate license and easy setup wizard provided by DrayTek, there is no need to invest in any costly hardware or software upgrades, ensuring peace of mind at an affordable price for all users and devices on your network. Considering that the Vigor2860 series router supports DSL, LTE and Ethernet WAN for fibre – there is little need to look any further for the most versatile, robust, affordable router to secure your web access.
