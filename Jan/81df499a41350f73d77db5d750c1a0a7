I’m trying new things to add some excitement to my love life. Last night, my girlfriend dressed up as a police officer, walked into our bedroom, and said: “I’m arresting you for being too good in bed.” After two minutes, she told me she was dropping the charges due to a lack of evidence. I’m kidding – I don’t have a girlfriend. Or a bedroom. I do have a cardboard box with Staff Writer written on it, though, which is held down by two bricks under a carport outside the office. There, I’m threatened with actual arrest from real police officers. Mostly for loitering and lighting fires in parking bays for warmth.
