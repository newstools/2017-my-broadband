Netflix has updated its app for Android, adding support for downloading content to SD cards. In November, Netflix announced that members could download series and films for offline viewing. The feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. The latest Android update adds SD card support, which provides users with a new download location app setting â€“ letting them control where downloaded content is saved.
