YouTube is rolling out its new in-app messaging platform, which has been in testing since last year. The new feature is currently only available in Canada, reports the Canadian Financial Post. “We wanted to start with Canada because Canadians are sharing 15% more videos than the average user, so it’s interesting to see this is actually a behaviour that happens more in Canada,” said Google’s Shimrit Ben Yair. “We launched this feature as an experiment last year (to a small group) and now we are rolling it out worldwide.” The chat feature allows users to send videos to each other and create group conversations. This removes the need to share and discuss videos using a separate messaging app.
