Mozilla has released Firefox 51 for Windows, Mac, Linux, and Android. The new version promises “a richer and safer experience on the web”, said Mozilla. The company said Firefox is now the first browser to support the new WebGL 2 standard, which gives developers “the ability to utilise compelling 3D graphics that are available for the first time on the web”. “WebGL 2 allows content creators to leverage more modern accelerated rendering features, like transform feedback, expanded texturing functionality, and multisampled rendering support.” The WebGL2 feature set works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. The updated browser is also focused on security, and web pages that collect passwords but have not been secured with HTTPS will be “more clearly highlighted as potential threats”. Unsecure pages will be marked with a grey lock icon with a red strike-through in the URL bar. Mozilla added that it is continuing to roll out multi-process Firefox for desktop users. “Instead of running all of Firefox in one process, Firefox now runs in two processes: one for the browser’s user interface and another for web page content.” “Today, more than half of desktop users are running Firefox in multiple processes.”
