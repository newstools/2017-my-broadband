Consumer Reports has updated its review of the new Macbook Pro, now recommending the device. Due to unreliable battery performance at launch, the publication did not give Apple’s new Macbook Pro its “Recommended” rating in the initial review. However, it was found that the device’s battery problems were the result of a bug in its Safari web browser, which Apple fixed in a software update released on 9 January. After testing the new Macbook Pro with the latest software update, the publication found the issues were resolved and officially recommended the product. “With the updated software, the three MacBook Pros in our labs all performed well, with one model running 18.75 hours on a charge,” said Consumer Reports. “Now that we’ve factored in the new battery-life measurements, the laptops’ overall scores have risen and all three machines now fall well within the recommended range in Consumer Reports ratings.”
