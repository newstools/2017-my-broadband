Brian Krebs, founder of Krebs on Security, said that Paras Jha – a student at Rutgers University and the president of DDoS mitigation service ProTraf – is behind the Mirai botnet. Jha’s LinkedIn profile states that he is a “passionate entrepreneur driven by the want to create”. His skillset for software development includes C#, Java, Golang, C, C++, PHP, x86 ASM, and web “browser languages” such as Javascript and HTML/CSS. The Mirai botnet author used the name Anna-Senpai, which Krebs said he has linked to Jha. When Krebs asked Jha about his alleged involvement with Mirai, he denied that he wrote the code or was involved in any DDoS attacks. “I don’t think there are enough facts to definitively point the finger at me,” said Jha. “Besides this article, I was pretty much a nobody. No history of doing this kind of stuff, nothing that points to any kind of sociopathic behavior. Which is what the author is, a sociopath.” Read the full Krebs On Security report here
