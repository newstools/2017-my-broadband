The ZA Central Registry (ZACR) said it is aware that certain users are experiencing challenges when using a ZAdotCity domain – .capetown, .joburg, or .durban – in email addresses. ZACR CEO Lucky Masilela said the newness of ZAdotCity domain names, and associated email addresses, may face certain hurdles. “For example, email servers and policies within public and private organisations may not recognise or allow access to emails having a ZAdotCity extension such as lucky@registry.joburg.” This is because organisations have email systems that only recognise domain names and associated email addresses with two or three character labels – such as .com, or .co.za – said the ZACR. While ZAdotCities domains have been plagued by these legacy issues since their launch in 2014, they are not the only top-level domains affected. Despite the fact that Internet standards dating back to 1987 allow for top-level domains of up to 63 characters, many legacy checks used to ensure the validity of email addresses don’t comply with this. The ZACR has called on local IT managers to review and adapt their organisations’ email system policies to accept emails from domains that use a dotCity domain. “The ZACR has grown the co.za domain into a notable 1.1 million plus Second Level Domain registrations,” said Masilela. “With the support of South Africa’s IT community, we can likewise grow dotCapeTown, dotJoburg, and dotDurban to impressive levels.” Over 11,000 ZAdotCity domains have been registered by the ZACR and its registrar partners since their launch in November 2014.
