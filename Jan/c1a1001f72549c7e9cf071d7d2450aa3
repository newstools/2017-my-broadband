Google’s G Suite team has announced that from 13 February, .js file attachments (JavaScript) will be blocked. “Gmail currently restricts certain file attachments (.exe, .msc, and .bat) for security reasons,” it said. “We will not allow .js file attachments as well. Similar to other restricted file attachments, you will not be able to attach a .js file and an in-product warning will appear.” “If you still need to send .js files for legitimate reasons, you can use Google Drive, Google Cloud Storage, or other storage solutions to share or send your files.”
