South Africa’s Internet Service Providers’ Association said it has never experienced a period of negative growth, with the association’s membership increasing over the past 21 years. The association’s membership count currently stands at 184 firms, which have all committed to upholding the ISPA Code of Conduct. “ISPA’s united voice has resulted in many legal, legislative, regulatory, competition, and consumer victories for the local web – all funded by member contributions,” said ISPA chair Graham Beneke. “For ISPs committed to doing things right, ISPA membership is a badge of respectability.” Beneke said ISPA membership has a number of benefits, including the building of consumer confidence, the opportunity to contribute to a fair legislative framework, and the development of local infrastructure. This includes the operation of South Africa’s most important Internet exchanges, which lowers the cost to communicate. ISPA was recognised as an IRB in 2009 and its Code of Conduct was formally adopted in 2002.
