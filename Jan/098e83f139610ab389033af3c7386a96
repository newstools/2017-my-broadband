3D TV is dead. Samsung has already dropped 3D support for its TVs, and LG and Sony will do the same this year. CNet reported that none of Sony and LG’s TVs launched this year will be able to show 3D content. In 2016, South Korea’s ET News reported that Samsung and LG were stepping away from 3D TV technology. Shortly after Samsung confirmed it was abandoning 3D, Philips did the same. “3D is dead,” said Danny Tack, director of product strategy and planning at Philips. “There are no 3D sources and nobody really wants 3D. It also complicates your TV a lot.” “Even LG has announced it’s not doing 3D anymore. LG who invested so much in their patterned retarder. We are depending on them for panels,” said Tack. LG’s Tim Alessi, director of new product development, told CNet that 3D was never embraced in the industry for home use. “We decided to drop 3D support for 2017 in order to focus our efforts on new capabilities such as HDR,” said Alessi. Looking at the top TVs on sale from Dion Wired and Makro, there are no 3D TVs from Samsung, while LG only offers a handful of TVs with 3D support.
