Advances in GPU technology mean that many of today’s PC gamers are playing titles in 4K. Technological improvements also allow gamers on a relatively low budget to experience high-quality 1080p visuals at good frame rates. While many budget gamers may opt to purchase second-hand components instead of new parts, the decent pricing of the latest generation of budget graphics cards makes it easier to pick up new hardware. AMD’s Polaris and Nvidia’s Pascal graphics card line-ups both include capable budget cards which pack high power for their price range. The table below compares the performance and pricing of new AMD and Nvidia graphics cards available in South Africa for under R5,000. Only cards from the latest generation of technologies were included. Both the Radeon RX and GeForce GTX 10-series cards compete in the budget gaming market, offering good gaming performance. Performance data for each card consists of its PassMark G3D Mark Score and its FutureMark 3DMark Score.
