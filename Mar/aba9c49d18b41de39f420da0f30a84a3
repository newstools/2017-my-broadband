As fibre expands across the country at a rapid pace, South Africans are taking advantage of having a world-class internet connection. With speeds reaching up to 1Gbps, the dream of accessing almost infinite content has become a reality. For DStv Premium customers with an Explora decoder, creating a first-rate entertainment hub in your home is as simple as connecting your Explora to your fibre, either through WiFi or an Ethernet cable. The connection incurs no extra costs from MultiChoice, and gives you access to an extended library of local and international entertainment. Along with full seasons of shows such as Pure Genius, Isibaya and Modern Family, you can also enjoy thousands of hours of movies through the 1000 movies in the M-Net Movies Collection in Catch Up Plus. And of course access to award-winning documentaries and the latest sports highlights packages. You can also access ShowMax for just R69 per month and enjoy unlimited access to thousands of shows – giving you the whole history of a specific show in one convenient place on your Explora. The connected Explora also gives you access to a handy feature – Remote Recording – which enables you to set recordings to your Explora from a laptop or cellphone when you are not home. Now you never need to be in trouble again for failing to record your spouses favourite show! DStv is also giving away a  3-month ShowMax voucher to DStv Premium customers who connect their Explora to fibre during March 2017.
