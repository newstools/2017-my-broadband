The stock market is a challenging investment environment, even for seasoned investors. Many people opt for unit trusts or retirement funds to make it easier for them to manage their long-term investments. For those who like to manage their own investments, programmes like Business Day TV’s Stock Watch are valuable. To see how analysts and portfolio managers performed on the show, MyBroadband looked at the stock picks of several guests. We looked at the performance of the shares over a 1-year period, which showed it is challenging to pick winners. The table below shows the performance of the shares selected by Business Day TV’s Stock Watch guests a year ago. It should be noted that dividends were not taken into account.
