Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler said it plans to invest in the expansion of its electric vehicle portfolio. The company will add more than 10 new Mercedes-Benz electric cars to its series by 2022. The focus is not only on electric cars, and the company will also use “all available means” to reduce CO2 emissions. “For this reason, efficient combustion engines will continue to be a significant element of the solution during the transitional period,” said Daimler. The company said a bridge technology along the way to electric mobility is plug-in hybrid drive, where Mercedes-Benz has eight models on the market. Another focus area for Daimler is on the development of autonomous driving. “The car has always been more than just a means of transport, and autonomous driving will allow a new dimension of individual freedom and safety.” “Already today, series-produced cars from Mercedes-Benz can, if the driver desires, independently change lanes, apply the brakes in an emergency, or park themselves.” “As well as cars, the trucks and buses from Daimler are also pioneers for autonomous driving in their respective sectors.”
