The Tiobe Index and PYPL Index for March 2017 have been released, with Java maintaining its number one spot on both lists. A top performer over the past month – and since its launch in 2014 – was Apple’s Swift language. Swift made the top 10 on the Tiobe list for the first time, and placed in 10th in the PYPL ranking. Swift is described as a general purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed for iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. The top 10 languages from each index are shown in the table below. RedMonk’s recently-released 2017 programming language rankings, using data from GitHub and Stack Overflow, also show a massive increase in the popularity of Swift. The language reached a top 15 ranking faster than any other language recorded by RedMonk. Researchers compiled data from the GitHub Archive and Stack Overflow language rankings to determine the most popular programming languages for the first quarter of 2017. JavaScript and Java remain the most popular programming languages. The rankings for the top 10 most popular languages have remained relatively stable, but new languages are experiencing big increases lower down the list. R has become a favourite programming language among statisticians and data scientists, and TypeScript saw a large increase in popularity this year. Multiple languages were tied for a position, as shown in the table below.
