Uber has launched pickup corrections on iOS in the US, Canada, and the UK, which allows users to update their pickup location if they request a ride from the wrong place. “We’ve tested this feature and found that it led to fewer cancellations and less stress,” said Uber. To change a pickup location after an Uber is en route, a user can tap “edit” next to the pickup location. The user can enter a new pickup location and tap “confirm” to notify the driver of the change. “This simple fix gives riders more control over their pickup experience and saves everyone time and avoidable headaches.”
