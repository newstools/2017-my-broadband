FNB is discontinuing its safe custody storage service in branches, the bank has announced. “The decision follows the bank’s regular review of service offerings to align with its business strategy, as well as the assessment of the product’s sustainability,” said FNB. The safe custody service includes deed boxes and safe deposit lockers in a bank branch. The decision comes after the safety deposit boxes of hundreds of FNB clients were stolen from the Parktown and Randburg FNB branches in December 2016. “With immediate effect, FNB will not accept any new safe custody applications from existing or new customers.” The bank said it will notify existing customers about the cancellation of the service. “While customers are advised to make collection arrangements by 1 June 2017, the bank will give customers until 30 June 2017 to complete all collections.” “FNB’s decision to cease the safe custody storage service enables the bank to focus on continuously improving customer experience through its range of services.”
