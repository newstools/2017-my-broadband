Facebook has revealed a personal fundraising feature which allows users to raise money for themselves or on behalf of others. Users will be able to set up a dedicated Facebook page with donation goals and information about their fundraiser. This feature is only available to Facebook users who are 18 and over, and fundraisers currently only cover the following categories: All fundraisers undergo a 24-hour review process, and the company said it would expand the categories in the future. Facebook users will be able to donate via a “Donate” button on the fundraising page. The beta phase of Facebook’s fundraising feature will roll out first in the US.
