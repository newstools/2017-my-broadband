Gumtree’s South African website has received a new homepage and several new features, said the company. The homepage will now feature trending ads, with ads that are most popular in a user’s area displayed. Activity card notifications – similar to Facebook, informing users of activity occurring near their location – and an improved search bar and location recognition system have also been implemented. Gumtree added that browsing on mobile devices has also been improved. More new features are expected to roll out over the next few months. “These changes follow the introduction of professional dashboards for property agents, automotive dealerships, recruiters, and professional sellers known as ProTool in late 2016,” said Gumtree. “Gumtree has also opted to add insertion fees to their Jobs and Services categories, which means that users posting more than two ads in this category will have to pay a small fee.” “This was done to reduce spam on the site, as well as weed out fraudulent adverts.”
