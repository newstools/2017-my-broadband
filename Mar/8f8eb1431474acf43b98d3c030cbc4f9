Launched just over a year ago, more than one developer finds work through the OfferZen platform each day. OfferZen has launched the first recruitment marketplace in South Africa, making it much faster and easier for software developers to get approached by top companies. More than 350 companies already use OfferZen, including startups like SnapScan, SweepSouth and TaxTim, as well as larger companies like Takealot, Barclays, Investec and Entelect. Unlike traditional recruiters and job boards, developers on OfferZen don’t apply to jobs. Rather, companies make the first contact by sending an interview request, which includes upfront salary information, working location and perks applicable to the position. Developers can get 5-10 interview requests in their first week on OfferZen. “Developers, by definition, use technology to solve real-world problems – yet in the job search they were forced to engage with an aging system.” said Philip Joubert, OfferZen co-founder. “Developers expect solutions with quick turn around time, where information is accessible and they have control over the process – without the need for a middle man. As developers ourselves, we just built what we would expect from the job hunting process.” Transparency is a key part of this new approach, and both developers and companies benefit from it. Through Offerzen’s innovative model, developers can receive and compare multiple job offers, while companies can benchmark their salaries with those competing in the same market. Developers looking to use OfferZen can expect hands-on support from a talent advisor, get help polishing their profiles, and gain support throughout their job search. Unlike recruiters, OfferZen’s talent advisors don’t receive a bonus when someone finds a job. For more information, and to sign up with OfferZen for free, visit the OfferZen website.
