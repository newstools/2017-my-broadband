The SABC has been fined R10,000 for using a “random” cellphone number in an episode of Isidingo, which resulted in a Johannesburg resident receiving hundreds of phone calls. According to a report by TimesLive, the incident stemmed from Shona Ferguson‚ who plays the character Tyson Mokoena, being asked to create a cellphone number for part of an Isidingo episode. A “random” number was chosen – which turned out to belong to Thapelo Diale. After the episode aired in November 2016, Diale reportedly received hundreds of phone calls – many of which contained strong verbal abuse. The Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa said the incident was “extraordinary and serious”, and blamed the show for not foreseeing the potential consequences of using a “random” number. The SABC was instructed to contact Diale’s employer and explain why she had received so many phone calls at work. It was also ordered to pay a R10,000 fine.
