Uber competitor Lyft has announced its new Round-Up programme, which allows riders to donate a portion of their fare to charity. The optional Round Up & Donate service rounds up the rider’s fare and donates the difference to charity. Lyft already has an existing tipping option, which lets riders show their appreciation to drivers by leaving a tip for good service. Users can choose whether to opt in for the donation programme. The service will roll out to Lyft riders over the next few weeks.
