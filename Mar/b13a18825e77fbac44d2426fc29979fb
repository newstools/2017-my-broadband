Samsung has created a virtual assistant named Bixby for its new smartphone. Bixby will make its debut on Samsung’s Galaxy S8, and is aimed at providing a user-friendly way to interact with apps. The device will sport a dedicated Bixby button, allowing users to call the virtual assistant without unlocking the phone. Like Siri and Cortana, Bixby will respond to voice commands and allow users to access various functions of their smartphone without navigating menus. Bixby will also be able to understand contextual and conversational commands, meaning it will remember the context of your conversation and allow you to make further commands without reiterating which functionality to use. Samsung said in a blog post that it is working on expanding the app ecosystem for Bixby. “At the launch of the Galaxy S8, a subset of preinstalled applications will be Bixby-enabled,” said Samsung. “Our plan is to eventually release a tool (in SDK) to enable third-party developers to make their applications and services Bixby-enabled.” Bixby will be implemented across Samsung smartphones, appliances, and TVs in the future.
