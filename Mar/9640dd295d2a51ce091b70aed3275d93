NASA has published its software catalogue for 2017-2018, making numerous programs, assets, and code libraries available for free. The catalogue includes everything from technical file delivery protocols to a spacewalk game. Many of the tools can be applied to situations on Earth, such as automated drone formation systems or photography and imaging software. The software collection also includes a number of 3D models. Nasa’s new catalogue of software is available for free from the space agency’s website.
