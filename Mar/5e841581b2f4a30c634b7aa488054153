The world land speed record attempt by the Bloodhound SSC team has been delayed, with the record attempt now set for the second half of 2018. The group said the Hakskeen Pan in South Africa flooded in January and March, which pushed the planned test runs further forward. “Allowing for similar events next year, and building in time to make final preparations to the track, we expect our advanced party to deploy to the Kalahari in summer 2018.” “We will begin our first World Land Speed Record campaign in the second half of 2018.” Further developments to the monopropellant rocket to increase its power output are also required before the record run. Project Director Richard Noble said it was frustrating to change the schedule.
