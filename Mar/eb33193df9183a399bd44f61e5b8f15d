While there are hundreds of millions of business printers in the world today, less than 2% of them are secure. To explain what a huge threat this poses to businesses and consumers, HP Studios’ has released the newly launched web series, The Wolf. Starring award-winning actor Christian Slater, the series highlights how corporate networks can be hacked and what companies must do to protect themselves. In the series, Slater systematically hacks a company – from the mailroom to the boardroom – through overlooked vulnerabilities and poorly secured printers and PCs. This first instalment reinforces that security is no longer just the responsibility of the network or something at the perimeter, but it’s a concern for everyone. The Wolf is directed by BAFTA and Emmy nominee Lance Acord and edited by Academy Award winner Kirk Baxter. “Hacking is a serious and growing problem for businesses and consumers,” said Christian Slater. “When HP asked me to partner on this series, I thought it was a great opportunity to help educate the public about how to better protect against cyber-attacks.” This forms part of a series of global initiatives that HP intends to launch to elevate awareness of the security risks facing businesses and consumers. Over the coming months, HP will be elevating its commitment to reinvent security through a broad range of partnerships, events and product innovations for the most secure devices, solutions and technologies.
