Did you know that SITA is embarking on the journey to establish and create Cloud Computing Platform for Government where all government Critical Services will be hosted? To achieve this significant task, SITA has decided to engage and collaborate with the industry to share some ideas on building this capability. The engagement with the industry will assist SITA to develop efficient cloud solutions that will assist Government to consolidate all ICT Infrastructure into a unified common platform. The industry day will cover various issues including, but not limited to: For example, the UK Government has put in a “cloud first policy”, which encourages public to consider purchasing cloud solutions first before they consider any option as the cloud option is deemed to be cost efficient and easy to deploy. South African Governmental Departments are no exception to this trend and need to explore the possibility of putting a “Cloud first” Policy to Government departments. Individual Government Departments showed a keen interest in Cloud technology as they look to drive efficient and effective service delivery to the citizens. There is also a need for the realisation of Disaster Recovery Capability, which can be achieved simply by the Cloud Computing Platform. To understand all these dynamic SITA has decided to go back to the industry (SITA Industry Day) to engage the industry with the intention of understanding. The above challenges will set a tone for the engagement between SITA and the industry. The Cloud initiative strives to further advance SITA’s mission in serving as the national Cloud service provider for South African Government Departments. Moreover, a work plan will be shared with the industry and Government partners after that. For any further information visit the SITA website. This article was published in partnership with SITA.
