Telkom plans to break out its real estate assets and telecommunications towers into a new unit listed separately on the stock market, reported Bloomberg. The new unit will reportedly be listed as a new entity and will focus on property and revenue generation for Telkom. Telkom said it would like its property portfolio, which is one of the largest real estate portfolios in South Africa, to contribute more to the company’s earnings. According to the report, the creation of the property-focused entity is part of the next step in Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko’s plan to turn the company around. Maseko’s plan also involves an inspection of other Telkom operations.
