Telkom will increase it analogue line rental price from R189 to R199, including VAT, from 1 April 2017. The new monthly tariffs for Telkom line rentals are as follows: A business service is priced at R299 per month. “For Consumer customers, our Telkom Anytime Extra, Anytime Plus, and Unlimited Fixed Line plans will have no price change,” said Telkom. “Customers are encouraged to consider these plans as an alternative to the slight line rental price increase.” South African ISPs have called for analogue line rental to be dropped as a requirement for ADSL users in the country, as many customers only use their Telkom copper line for Internet services. With the price of the compulsory line rental now at R199, it will make up an increased portion of an ADSL user’s bill – and is a large chunk of the total cost on low-end lines, such as a 2Mbps service.
