The Democratic Alliance has called on Parliament to defend South Africa’s constitution and fire President Jacob Zuma. This follows Zuma’s cabinet reshuffle, which saw him firing Minister of Finance, Pravin Gordhan, and the Deputy Minister of Finance, Mcebesi Jonas. “This should be a rallying call for all South Africans to stand together and defend our hard-won Constitutional Democracy,” said DA leader Mmusi Maimane. “The President has once again shown that he has no interest in our beloved country’s future – or the 9 million South Africans who are unemployed.” Maimane said Zuma has bowed to the whims of those who are determined to enrich themselves at the expense of the poor and jobless. “This is an act of complete state capture,” Maimane said. “We cannot sit by and let this happen. It is time that all South Africans stand together to protect our democracy.” The DA leader said it is Parliament who hired Jacob Zuma and it is Parliament that can fire him. “We therefore urge all political parties, including members of the ANC, to vote President Jacob Zuma out when the DA’s motion of no confidence is debated in the National Assembly.” “The time is now. We must stand together and defend what so many fought and died for,” said Maimane.
