Uber president Jeff Jones has resigned from the company following recent controversy surrounding the business, reported Recode. Jones said his beliefs were not consistent with the practices occurring in the ride-sharing business. “I joined Uber because of its mission, and the challenge to build global capabilities that would help the company mature and thrive long-term,” said Jones. “It is now clear, however, that the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the business.” This follows recent controversial reports regarding the company, including allegations of sexual harassment by a former engineer. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said the company will hire a new COO to assist him in running the operation. “We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best,” said Uber.
