Most modern smartphones feature water and dust protection, although the extent of a phone’s resistance is not always clear. In order to classify smartphones as water and dust resistant, manufacturers must pass tests as defined by International Electrotechnical Commission standards. Devices must obtain an Ingress Protection Code, which defines the water and particle resistance of an enclosure. A device’s IP Code consists of two digits, which define the enclosure’s solid particle protection and liquid ingress protection. For example, the Samsung Galaxy S7 has an IP rating of IP68 – with the first digit referring to dust protection and the second digit referring to liquid protection. The device’s solid particle protection rating of 6 means it is completely dust-tight, and its liquid ingress protection rating of 8 means it can remain submerged at a depth of 1.5m for 30 minutes (as defined by Samsung). Below is an outline of IP ratings, as defined by IEC standard 60529. Modern “waterproof” smartphones usually feature an Ingress Protection Code of IP68, but the extent of the smartphone’s resistance varies according to manufacturer specifications. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and CAT S60 both feature a rating of IP68, with the S7 Edge certified to be submerged at a depth of 1.5m for 30 minutes, while the Cat S60 can remain at a depth of 5m for one hour. Sony previously encountered problems with the classification of its Z1 smartphone as “waterproof” in South Africa, as it did not submit reports detailing its Ingress Protection Code when a user lodged a complaint with the ASA. The ASA later ruled that Sony could call the Xperia Z1 waterproof after it submitted evidence which upheld its Ingress Protection rating. Consumers must keep in mind that not all IPX8-rated devices have equal levels of water resistance, and you should consult the manufacturer’s specifications per device.
