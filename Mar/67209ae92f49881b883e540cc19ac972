Researchers announced they can now store data in DNA strands with 100% accuracy. The researchers stored 215 petabytes (215,000,000GB) in a single gram of DNA, with perfect decoding and retrieval. According to the study, data stored in DNA strands can last for tens of thousands of years and will not become obsolete as quickly as conventional data storage devices. The researchers used DNA Fountain coding theory to encode the data, allowing them to piece together complete files when decoding – even if small sections of data were lost. The method has limitations, though, as it takes around 24 hours to decode 2MB of data and costs $7,000 to encode and decode.
