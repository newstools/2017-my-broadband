MTN South Africa has appointed Godfrey Motsa as its new CEO. Motsa replaces Mteto Nyati, who is leaving the company to join Altron. Motsa is the fifth MTN South Africa CEO in five years, which points to a lack of consistent leadership at the operator. Nyati served as MTN SA CEO for less than two years after he took over from Ahmad Farroukh in July 2015. Farroukh resigned as MTN SA CEO after just 11 months at the helm – after taking over from Zunaid Bulbulia on 31 July 2014. Bulbulia was also not CEO of MTN South Africa for long. He was appointed on 29 May 2013, and left the position 13 months later. The infographic below details MTN South Africa’s CEOs and MDs over the last decade.
