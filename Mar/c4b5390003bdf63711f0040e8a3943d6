Google incubator Area 120 has launched Uptime, an app that lets you watch YouTube videos with your friends. The app is initially only available on iOS, and looks very different from the normal YouTube app. According to The Verge, the app works best with vertical videos. While watching a video, the profile icons of people watching the video float across the screen and you can comment or post emoji. Reactions are displayed to anyone who watches the video, including those who watch it later.
