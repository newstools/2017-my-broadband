Razer will pay you zSilver, its virtual currency, for playing popular video games on your PC. When playing games like Dota 2, League of Legends, Overwatch, and CS:GO using Razer Cortex, gamers will earn three zSilver each minute. The currency can then be redeemed for Razer products. Razer also announced that its USB-powered Chroma Mug Holder is available exclusively as a reward and can be purchased with the virtual currency. The Chroma Mug Holder features Razer’s Chroma RGB lighting and Synapse connectivity, and can be set up to blink at certain intervals – reminding a gamer to stay hydrated. The device requires an Internet connection and Synapse registration, after which it can be used offline. Gamers can earn up to a maximum of 900 zSilver per day using Razer’s programme, which equates to around five hours of daily gameplay.
