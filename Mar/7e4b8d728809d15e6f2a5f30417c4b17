Qualcomm has unveiled its 205 Mobile Platform, which is designed to bring 4G LTE connectivity to entry-level feature phones. The 205 platform includes the Qualcomm 205 system-on-a-chip, which encompasses the baseband functionalities – including an RF front end, discrete Wi-Fi, power management, audio codec, speaker amplifier, and software. “The platform supports consumers, micro-enterprises, and others to economically communicate using advanced LTE data services such as Voice-over-LTE and Voice-over-Wi-Fi,” said Qualcomm. Apart from faster speeds through LTE connectivity, benefits include improved battery life and better security. “Feature phones are a lifeline in many emerging countries and the 205 Mobile Platform allows us to bring 4G connectivity and services to the masses with devices at price points never seen before.”
