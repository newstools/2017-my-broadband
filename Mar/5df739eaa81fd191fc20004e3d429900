Microsoft has unveiled a major update for the Xbox One, adding streaming improvements and an updated Home screen. The update improves the Home screen interface, simplifying the UI and increasing system performance. It also add features, including a dynamic background based on the game users are playing. Pressing the Xbox button on the controller opens the overhauled Xbox guide as an overlay on the left of the screen. The new guide overlay allows users to access games and apps, music, screenshots, and video recording. The update also includes a new achievement tracker based on the current game being played and a Cortana overlay which can be controlled via voice commands. Users can stream their Xbox gameplay directly from the guide overlay and can record video of the last five minutes of gameplay at the touch of a button. Additional features include Copilot, which allows two controllers to function as a single input device – adding cooperative controls for any game.
