X, the research and development company owned by Google parent Alphabet, has unveiled new smart glasses called Glass Enterprise Edition. The product is a reboot of the original Google Glass and sports the same mini-computer mounted on the frames. Glass Enterprise Edition has been in development for two years and has been redesigned for improved access to information in various professional environments. The wearable computer can also be mounted to industry frames like safety goggles, in addition to traditional spectacles. The smart glasses can deliver information such as guides, instructions, and checklists directly to a workerâ€™s line of sight without them stopping to consult these resources. X is making Glass Enterprise Edition available through its partner network.
