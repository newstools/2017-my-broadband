Canonical’s Ubuntu Linux is now available in the Windows Store, which makes it easier for users to install the Linux OS. This follows Microsoft stating that Ubuntu, SUSE, and Fedora Linux are coming to the Windows Store. The Ubuntu installation through the Windows Store is sandboxed, and is aimed at running command line utilities like bash, SSH, Git, and Apt. Microsoft also announced in May that it was working on SUSE Linux and Fedora Linux running on the Windows Subsystem for Linux. “Now, Windows is the only platform that can run both Windows apps and Linux apps side-by-side,” said Microsoft. Commentators said it is a “great move so that updates for Ubuntu will be separate from Windows”. It is advised to install Ubuntu in drive C: or “you will get a file system error”.
