Kaspersky has launched a free antivirus, called Kaspersky Free. The antivirus comes with the ability to block malware and keep a PC protected from threats. This includes the scanning of local files, a web antivirus, IM antivirus, and mail antivirus. Softpedia reported that Kaspersky Free has been tested in several markets, including Russia and China, and has received positive feedback. The report stated that the US and Canada will receive access to the software in July, while other large markets – including the UK, France, and Spain – will receive the antivirus in October. “With practically zero promo activity, Kaspersky Free was installed several million times, in doing so cranking up our market share considerably,” said Eugene Kaspersky. “Tools like a firewall, private browsing, and application control are only available as part of Kaspersky Internet Security,” said Softpedia.
