Uber has announced that there will be a charge of $15 for the return of a lost item in certain US cities. “Drivers are independent contractors and this is to compensate them for their time. The entire fee is passed on to the driver,” said Uber. The best way to retrieve an item is to call the driver. “If your driver picks up and confirms that your item has been found, coordinate a mutually-convenient time and place to meet for its return to you.” If the driver doesn’t pick up, users can leave a voicemail describing the item and contact information. “Please be considerate that your driver’s personal schedule will be affected by taking time out to return your item to you,” said Uber. Uber said that neither the company nor drivers are responsible for items left in a vehicle after a trip ends.
