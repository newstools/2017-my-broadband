Niantic Labs held a Pokémon GO anniversary event, called Pokémon GO Fest, in Chicago this past weekend, which did not go as planned. Technical problems plagued the event, with players unable to connect to the game’s servers and participate. Niantic said it encountered software and network problems which prevented many people from connecting to the game. It said issues with the game software caused client crashes and interfered with gameplay for users. The gameplay issue was resolved with a server configuration change, and the crashes were addressed for many users. “A more protracted problem was caused by oversaturation of the mobile data networks of some network providers,” said Niantic. “This caused many attendees to be unable to access Pokémon GO or other Internet services. Network congestion also led to a login issue which affected some users. This latency-related login issue was addressed with a second Niantic configuration change.” Niantic said its event partner worked with the major carriers to allow them to plan for coverage and throughput requirements, with certain carriers deploying additional capacity. “Wi-Fi was enabled by one provider as a solution which helped some users, but not all. Sprint was onsite as an official partner, deployed a COW, and their network was busy, but held up well.” Niantic said it made a number of adjustments to the event plan, and offered refund tickets to those who requested them. It also gave all attendees $100 in PokéCoins. Niantic said that from late Saturday to Sunday, players in Chicago participated in over 69,000 Raid Battles and captured more than 7.7 million Pokémon – including 440,000 Legendary Pokémon.
