Afrihost has launched fixed LTE-A packages based on the Rain network. The Fixed Wireless packages are available in three sizes – 55GB, 85GB, and 120GB – and follow the launch of Rain-based products from other local ISPs. “Fixed Wireless is aimed at providing high-speed, reliable wireless Internet in areas that do not have DSL or Fibre coverage,” said Afrihost. “All Afrihost Fixed Wireless packages are subject to a once-off purchase of a Huawei B618 LTE-A Wireless Router for R2,499. The dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) B618 can connect up to 64 devices at a time.” Users are advised to check if their area is covered by Rain’s network before signing up for a package.
