Xiaomi has revealed its Mi AI Speaker, its equivalent to Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Home. As reported by Engadget, the speaker will accept voice commands and play music, and will sell for $45 when it launches in China in August. The device features a six-microphone array – which will let it detect voice commands from any direction – and has an “artificial intelligence” system built in. Xiaomi said the speaker will accept third-party apps and can be used to control other Xiaomi Mi products.
