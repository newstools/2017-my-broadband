Elon Musk has bought back X.com from PayPal, thanking PayPal on Twitter for the transaction. X.com was the domain of Musk’s second start-up, an online bank that became PayPal following a merger with Confinity in March 2000. Confinity’s PayPal product allowed Palm Pilot owners to send money to each other through its infrared ports. Its functionality was expanded to transfer money using email and the web, and in June 2001, X.com was renamed PayPal. PayPal said it was delighted to sell the domain to Musk. The amount it was sold for has not been disclosed. Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back https://t.co/bOUOejO16Y! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 11, 2017
