Microsoft has delayed the launch of its Timeline feature, which will allow users to switch between multiple devices – like Android and iOS smartphones. “Timeline won’t be in the Fall Creators Update. We’re planning for it to be in early Insider builds shortly after the Fall Creators Update is out,” said Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore. Timeline also allows users to move “back in time” to find what they were working on. The Timeline feature has a scrollbar, which makes it possible to scroll through your history of apps and documents which were used. This lets users pick up where they left off without any disruption in their workflow, said Microsoft.
