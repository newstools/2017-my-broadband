Toyota is working on a new electric car powered by a cutting-edge solid-state battery, reported Reuters. The new type of battery will reportedly be able to charge within a few minutes. Current electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries, which need up to 30 minutes to charge using fast-charging technology and have a range of up to 400km – depending on the vehicle. According to the report, Toyota’s upcoming electric car will be sold in Japan in 2022 and the company will commercialise solid-state batteries by the early 2020s. Toyota reportedly plans to produce new electric cars in China starting in 2019, although these early models will use lithium-ion batteries.
