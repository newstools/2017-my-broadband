TV networks are purposefully misspelling their show names to avoid bad ratings through Nielsen’s rating system, according to reports. An example in the report was NBC spelling its “Nightly News” show as “Nitely News” on days when ratings were expected to be low – such as coinciding with big sport events or holidays. NBC has misspelt the name 14 times in the current TV season, stated the report. Other networks to allegedly engage in the practice include ABC and CBS – with “Wrld News Tonite” and “CBS Evening Nws” respectively. The reason for the incorrect names is that the Nielsen rating system separates the “misspelt show” from the “main show”, which means it does not affect its ratings average. This is beneficial for the networks on low-ratings days, as the figures are used for commercial purposes, such as advertising sales.
