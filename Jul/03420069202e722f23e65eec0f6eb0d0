The reported prices of several large Nasdaq-listed stocks spiked or plummeted after the closing bell on Monday due to a glitch, Reuters reported. The stock exchange closed early for Independence Day in the US. According to the stock tickers on news websites, the shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft all appeared to be priced at $123.47. The Nasdaq told the Financial Times the glitch was due to an improper use of test data, and that prices on its websites were not affected. No trades were executed at the erroneous prices, and the actual prices of the stocks were not affected.
