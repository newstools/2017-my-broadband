A research team in China has teleported a photon from the ground in Tibet to a satellite orbiting 500km above it, the MIT Review reported. The satellite was launched from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre last year and is a highly-sensitive photon receiver which can detect the quantum states of photons fired from the ground. Researchers were able to create the first satellite-to-ground quantum network, which they used to teleport the first object from the ground to orbit. They set up a ground station in Tibet, which is at an altitude of around 4,000m. The scientists then created entangled pairs of photons at a rate of 4,000 per second. This was done by creating the photons at the same instant and point in space. When two quantum objects become entangled, they share the same quantum state. What you do to one happens to both. Entanglement is easily lost, however, as photons interact with particles in the atmosphere and in fibre. To minimise the risk of a photon being sent up to the satellite becoming unentangled, the researchers transmitted it when the satellite was at its closest point to the ground station. They measured the photons on the ground and in orbit to confirm they were entangled, achieving quantum teleportation over the longest distance to date. Millions of photons were sent into orbit over a month, with 911 of them remained entangled with the ones on the ground.
