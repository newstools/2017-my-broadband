Liquid Telecom has successfully raised $700 million in a bond and term loan financing package. The company raised $550 million in the international debt capital markets in its debut bond, in addition to a $150-million term loan. Liquid Telecom Group CEO Nic Rudnick said he is pleased with the strong support and interest the company has received internationally. “We launched into a challenging market, and have attracted investors of high quality – many of whom are investing in African high-yield bonds for the first time,” he said. “This is a significant achievement for an African tech company.” The senior secured notes will bear interest at a rate of 8.5% per annum and will be guaranteed by Liquid Telecom. Liquid Telecom said it will use the proceeds of the offering for the refinancing of the company’s existing debt and general corporate purposes. The funding will also enable the company to expand its fibre network. Liquid Telecom has built over 50,000km of fibre connecting nine countries in Africa, and currently serves over 113,000 customers.
