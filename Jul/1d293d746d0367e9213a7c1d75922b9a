MyBroadband’s 2017 Salary Survey results revealed that BBD, Capitec Bank, MiX Telematics, Vodacom, and Investec have the happiest IT employees in South Africa. The survey was completed by 3,062 South Africans who work in the IT sector, and included executives and professionals from large tech companies. To ensure accurate results, MyBroadband applied various filters to eliminate entries which raised red flags. As part of the survey, IT professionals were asked how happy they are in their current job, and whether they are looking for a new job. MyBroadband used this data to rank companies based on the happiness of their IT staff. The companies were split into three industries – telecommunications, finance, and general IT. The charts below detail the results.
