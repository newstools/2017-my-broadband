Nokia and Openserve have conducted successful G.fast trials to “provide higher-speed broadband to more customers sooner”. G.fast leverages existing copper infrastructure to supply high-speed broadband to users, and is aimed at multi-dwelling-units. “Nokia and Openserve have successfully conducted a trial of G.fast technology in an office complex in Pinelands, reaching fibre-like speeds over existing copper infrastructure,” said Nokia. The trial is a dry-run for Openserve’s commercial deployment of G.fast later this year, it said. Results from the trial showed an aggregate bandwidth – upstream and downstream – of 900Mbps on short copper loops. Speeds of between 500Mbps and 250Mbps were reached on an existing copper line at a distance of 150 metres. The G.fast tests follow an announcement by Telkom in June that it plans to deploy 100Mbps DSL services in South Africa using the technology. Nokia said G.fast will reduce disruptions and lower barriers to entry with home owners in complexes and home-owner associations when it comes to installing high-speed broadband. Areas that are “cumbersome to reach with fibre” can access the benefits of G.fast thanks to fibre only needing to be deployed to a main building, as opposed to individual residences. Openserve CEO Alphonzo Samuels said G.fast is a great alternative in scenarios where the length of the copper tail is 150 metres or less. Nokia said it is the industry leader in G.fast technology, with over 40 customer trials completed and 10 customers commercially deploying around the world.
