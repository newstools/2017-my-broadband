Adobe has released an update for the iOS and Android versions of its Photoshop Lightroom photo editing app, and has redesigned the Android software from the ground up. Lightroom is now completely native app on Android, and features an updated interface which aims to improve accessibility and performance. The Android version of the application includes support for new cameras and lenses and general stability improvements, but still lacks some new features which will only be available in the iOS app. Adobe also added new features to the iOS app, including a new Brush Selection tool and improved 3D Touch support.
