Intel is retrenching staff in its Internet of Things group after discontinuing three of its IoT-related products, Electronics Weekly reported. 97 jobs will be cut at its Santa Clara office, along with up to 40 jobs in Ireland. The company announced last month that its compute modules – the Galileo, Joule, and Edison – will no longer be available for purchase from September. Intel’s compute modules featured a similar form factor to the Raspberry Pi and were aimed at IoT developers.
