Twitter’s stock price has risen more than 40% since its earnings report in April, when many investors were ready to write off the company, reported Reuters. According to the report, Twitter saw renewed interest in its shares after it reported a higher-than-expected user growth figure, reaching 328 million users. Its subscriber growth will be a focus point on Thursday, when it is expected to release its next quarterly earnings report. Twitter is expected to report quarterly revenue of $536.6 million – a decrease of 10.9% from $602 million a year earlier, reported Reuters. However, investors remain upbeat about the business, due to the number of people on the platform – including public figures like US President Donald Trump.
