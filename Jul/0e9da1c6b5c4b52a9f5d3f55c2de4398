Webafrica and MWEB recently launched new fixed LTE-A packages which run on the Rain network. As many South Africans rely on fixed-LTE services as their primary source of broadband connectivity – due to poor speeds on their ADSL line and a lack of fibre availability – the launch was welcome news to many. One of the issues noted by potential users, however, was the lack of large data packages, and no uncapped or after-hours bonus data with the ISPs’ LTE services. At launch, Webafrica and MWEB offered the following month-to-month deals: Webafrica told MyBroadband there are plans to offer more packages over Rain’s LTE network, including bigger data bundles. 200GB and larger packages are “on the product roadmap for the future” and will offer users cheaper per-GB rates, said Webafrica. The ISP is also looking into “night time” data allocations, which will give users an allotment of data to use after hours. “We are hopeful it will become a reality in the near future,” it said. Webafrica said Rain’s intention is to compete directly with fixed-line connectivity providers, but limited spectrum will always hold back uncapped LTE packages with FUPs. MWEB said at this stage it was launching the three products only.
