Google is providing prominent results for the “best torrent sites”, which may not go down well with copyright holders. Many torrent websites have closed down in recent years and users are searching for the best alternatives. TorrentFreak discovered that typing in “best torrent sites” or “torrent sites” results in Google providing “a fancy reel of several high-traffic indexers”. “The search engine displays the names of sites such as RARBG, The Pirate Bay, and 1337x as well as their logos. When you click on a link, Google brings up all results for the associated term,” it said. Google said this does not reflect “what we had in mind for this feature”, and it was “looking into it”.
