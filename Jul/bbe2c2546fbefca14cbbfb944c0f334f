SilverStone has unveiled its Raven RVZ03Â gaming PC chassis. The chassis supports Mini-ITX and Mini-DTX motherboards, in addition to a full-sized ATX power supply. A discrete graphics card can be connected to a built-in PCIe riser card, with the case supporting units up to 330mm in length. There are no 3.5-inch drive bays in the RVZ03, but the case does feature support for up to four 2.5-inch storage drives. SilverStone has adorned the front of the small chassis with an RGB light strip and included a control box for the lighting with the case. The Raven RVZ03 is set to launch later this year. No pricing is currently available.
