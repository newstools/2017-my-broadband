LastPass has unveiled its new family-oriented password storage platform called LastPass Families. LastPass Families will allow you to manage your familyâ€™s digital life by storing passwords, credit card details, and other important sensitive information in a secure shared vault. Users can decide which family members they share information with and can keep personal information in a private vault which is inaccessible by other family members. LastPass Families also includes a backup plan which collects all stored data and gives emergency access to a chosen family member. The account supports up to six members and will be available for purchase later this year.
