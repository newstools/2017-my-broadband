Lucid Motors, an electric car maker, has posted a video of its prototype sedan reaching 378km/h. The run was completed on a test track and required the company to remove the software speed limiter which was installed in the vehicle. The fast speeds are unlikely to be seen in commercial models, however, as many car manufacturers have agreed to a 250km/h speed limit cap for safety purposes. This includes companies such as Tesla. A video of the speed test is below.
