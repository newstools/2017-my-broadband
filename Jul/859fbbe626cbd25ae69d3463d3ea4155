Internet Solutions has deployed its first point of presence in Madagascar and has commissioned a second PoP in Zambia. Co-locating with Airtel Madagascar and NetOne in Zambia, the IS PoPs provide clients with access to local Internet networks in each country without the need to identify and contract with local Internet service providers. This results in network redundancy and streamlined service provision, which is attractive to global carriers and multinationals which manage networks that need to operate in several African markets, said IS. Internet Solutions now has 68 PoPs in 16 African markets, as well as international PoPs. “We can boast a significant managed services network on the continent because of our investment in both infrastructure assets and partnerships with trusted, in-country service providers,” said Murray Steyn, head of wholesale at IS.
