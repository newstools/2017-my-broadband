OneDrive no longer works with hard drives not formatted to the NTFS file system, according to a report by Ars Technica. OneDrive users have found that the cloud storage system shows an error message for drives using FAT32, exFAT, and ReFS file systems. Files must now be stored on an NTFS volume, stated the report. It should be noted that NTFS is the default file system for modern Windows operating systems. Microsoft said OneDrive was always meant to warn users using non-NTFS file systems, and that a “bug” allowed drives with other file systems to work with the service. The report stated that the upcoming Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, which features a revamp of OneDrive’s functionality, may be the reason for the apparent policy change.
