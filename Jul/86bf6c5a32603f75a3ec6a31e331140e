A Google Pixel smartphone owner has reported on Reddit that his device caught fire and exploded 45 minutes after being fully charged. According to the report, the device was not running any apps and had not suffered recent damage. The Pixel owner said he didn’t want to post the incident on social media, as he wanted to resolve the issue through the proper channels. However, he took to Reddit when 12 hours passed without feedback on a replacement phone or a refund. The Pixel owner said he subsequently received confirmation that the phone will be replaced for free. The phone also damaged a tablet when it caught fire, he added.
