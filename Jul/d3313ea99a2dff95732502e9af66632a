Openserve has reported a major incident of cable theft in the Bishop Lavis area. This follows a similar incident in May, and Openserve said multiple cables have been cut and stolen. Lucas Ndala, Openserve’s chief of operations, said this has a major effect on the surrounding communities. “At this stage, we are aware of 14 of our street distribution cabinets that are affected by this outage,” said Ndala. “Despite preventative measures taken after the incident in May, thieves managed to break into welded manholes to get to our cables.” Areas affected include the Airport Industrial region, the surrounding industrial areas and shopping complexes, and residential suburbs. “We would like to assure the affected communities that we are prioritising the replacement of these stolen or damaged cables and will do our utmost to restore services in the shortest possible time frame.” The theft was reported to the SAPS, and Openserve asked anyone with information to contact it on 0800 124 000.
