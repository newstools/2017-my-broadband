The USB 3.0 Promoter Group has announced the upcoming release of the USB 3.2 specification. USB 3.2 will support multi-lane configurations, allowing for up to two lanes of 10Gbps operation. This effectively doubles transfer speeds over USB Type-C cables, increasing maximum data transfer rates to over 2GB/s. To get the full benefit of the new technology, a USB 3.2 device must be connected to a USB 3.2 host controller over a USB Type-C SuperSpeed cable. USB 3.2 devices will remain compatible with USB 3.0 and earlier devices. The new specification is expected to launch in September 2017.
