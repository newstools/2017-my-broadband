The National Consumer Commission (NCC) is investigating the timeshare holiday accommodation industry, which consumers say has tricked them into signing expensive contracts. Many consumers were lured to presentations about “holiday club points” schemes with the promise of a free gift, only to be put under pressure to sign up. The schemes typically require members to pay a monthly fee for the service, which promises them exotic holidays using a points system. However, many consumers who signed up did not receive what was promised to them. Complaints which the NCC is investigating include: The NCC said it has received thousands of complaints regarding the timeshare holiday industry in recent years, which prompted the investigation. Hearings have already taken place in Gauteng, with further hearings in the rest of the country scheduled. The Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa’s (ASA) Gail Schimmel said it has a specific section dealing with timeshare advertising. Schimmel said advertisements which promise people a prize to lure them to presentations are often misleading, and break their code of conduct. She said companies must clearly state it is a gift and not a prize, and explain what is needed to get that gift. This includes when the gift will be given, and how long attendees will have to listen to a presentation to receive the gift. Consumers have said it is best to avoid these schemes altogether. “If you ever get phoned and told that you have won a prize for some competition you don’t remember entering, do not listen to them,” said a consumer. “They will ask you to pick up your prize and listen to a presentation. Do not go.”
