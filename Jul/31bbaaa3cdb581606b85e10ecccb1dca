Standard Bank will remove data charges on its smartphone banking app. The bank has reached an agreement with all major network operators in South Africa to zero-rate data used to access the Standard Bank app. Standard Bankâ€™s app allows customers to access and manage accounts, make payments, check balances, and purchase products. Other features of the Standard Bank app include the ability to view balances without signing in, activating cards for international travel, and searching for nearby ATMs.
