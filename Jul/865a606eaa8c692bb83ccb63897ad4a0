Openserve, Telkom’s wholesale and networks division, has announced wholesale price reductions on its DSL and fibre broadband services which will kick in on 1 August 2017. The price cuts will be applied to IP Connect (IPC), Openserve’s wholesale ADSL offering as well as to its Openserve Fibre Broadband (OFB) access portfolio. When pricing is adjusted down next month, the company’s clients that purchase IPC capacity will pay 25% less than they do today. This latest cut on the cost of IPC follows the reductions announced in May this year. Openserve will also implement speed increases and price reductions across its OFB portfolio of wholesale offerings. “Our 2Mbps and 8Mbps offerings will be upgraded to 4Mbps and 10Mbps respectively. These migrations will occur free of charge,” said Openserve chief executive officer Alphonzo Samuels. “In addition to the upgrades, the wholesale pricing across entire OFB portfolio will decrease by an average of 9% across the portfolio,” he said. “We will work closely with the resellers of our broadband products to ensure the benefits of these price reductions filter through to the end user with either price reductions or enhanced services,” said Samuels.
