The Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University have developed an experimental patch of dissolving microneedles. The patch can be used to deliver drugs or vaccines, and the patient feels no pain when the patch is applied. Biodegradable microneedles dissolve within minutes after insertion into the skin and give the patch the ability to carry a dry vaccine. This means pharmacies can store patches loaded with vaccines without the need for a refrigerator. Studies found the patch is safe and effective at delivering flu vaccinations.
