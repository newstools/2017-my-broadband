The Dungeons & Dragons rules and digital tools website from Wizards of the Coast and Curse, D&D Beyond, will be integrated with Amazon’s Twitch streaming service, Engadget reported. D&D Beyond will function as a digital companion to the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, but unlike similar digital tools launched for previous editions these won’t be just a supplement to the paper rule books. According to the report, the ultimate aim of D&D Beyond is to replace the paper books. The books will remain in print as long as there is demand. To sign up for D&D Beyond, you will need a Twitch account. Engadget reported that the company has plans to link D&D campaigns into the streaming site, showing campaign and character details as you stream. Many of the advanced tools planned for the service won’t be ready for its August launch, however. The rules compendium, character builder, and spell book will be available at launch and free to registered users. Paying subscribers will receive access to features such as homebrew content and the ability to store unlimited characters. One-time purchases of guides and special character classes will also become available. Dungeons Masters may opt for the most expensive “Master Tier”, which will let them share premium content with their players.
