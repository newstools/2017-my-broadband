AMD’s upcoming Ryzen Threadripper processors could come bundled with an all-in-one liquid cooling solution, Techspot reports. According to Japanese website Hermitage Akihabara, standard models of the Ryzen Threadripper 1950X and 1920X will both include a stock AIO CPU cooler. The 1920X and 1920X are set to be priced at $1,000 and $800 respectively, though it is unclear whether these prices include a bundled liquid cooling system. AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper processors are aimed at the high-end desktop market and boast a high core count along with increased power consumption, making CPU cooling a priority. Ryzen Threadripper processors will be available for pre-order internationally from 27 July and will begin shipping in August.
