The electronic tagging of “almost 600 dangerous parolees” has been scrapped, according to a report by the Sunday Times. The move comes after the Department of Correctional Services and the supplier – Engineered Systems Solutions – engaged in a dispute over an unpaid bill of R100 million. The electronic tagging system was used to monitor convicts who were given parole after committing “serious violent crimes” and those who had served life sentences. The report stated that the department has been told to cut back on spending, and the contract was cancelled after a Special Investigating Unit probe into how it was awarded was initiated. All tagged offenders will now be “de-tagged with immediate effect”. The department reportedly stated it will “physically monitor” the parolees to make sure the community is safe. Following the original cancellation announcement to Engineered Systems Solutions in March, the company took the department to court, as the contract was set to run until 2019. Engineered Systems Solutions said it has not been paid by the department for over a year. The news follows reports of the continued investigation into a R494-million contract between the department and Integritron for an integrated inmate management system.
