Google has announced an update to the news feed in the Google app for Android and iOS. The news feed will not only be based on your interactions with Google, but also factor in what is trending in your area and around the world. You will still see cards that will feature things like sports highlights, top news, engaging videos, new music, and stories to read. “The more you use Google, the better your feed will be,” Google said You can also follow or unfollow topics without relying on Google’s machine learning algorithm to detect what you are interested in. On certain types of search results you will be able to click a “follow” button, and to unfollow something you can tap on its card or visit the Google app’s settings. The updated feed launches in the United States today and will roll out around the world in the next few weeks, Google said.
