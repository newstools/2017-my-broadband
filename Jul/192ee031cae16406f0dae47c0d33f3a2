Apple is set to release a new Watch before the end of 2017, according to a report by DigiTimes. The report stated that the upcoming launch of the third-generation Apple Watch will coincide with the planned release of watchOS 4. Rumours state that the new Watch will feature an improved battery life along with new features â€“ including sleep tracking. Swimming support is also expected to be improved. Standalone cellular support, which will remove the need for the Watch to be paired with an iPhone to perform connected functions, is also rumoured to be in the works. Apple traditionally holds its big iPhone launch event in September each year, and there is a possibility the new Watch will be unveiled then.
