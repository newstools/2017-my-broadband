Liquid Telecom has informed clients about its new NeoBroadband product portfolio, offering price cuts of up to 58%. NeoBroadband fibre packages are uncapped and offer symmetrical download and upload speeds, and are aimed at the business market. These packages therefore do not compete against much cheaper fibre-to-the-home services. Each service is allocated five static public IP addresses. For businesses that need a NAT solution, only one public IP address will be made available. It also possible to add on voice services, with 12 SIP channels priced at R500 per month, up to 36 SIP channels for R1,300 per month. Clients will have to sign a 12 or 24-month contract, depending on feasibility, said Liquid Telecom. Packages will include a router for new clients, while existing clients may keep their router. The company warned that it may become incapable of managing the higher bandwidths supported on the network, however. “Liquid Telecom will provide a new router on extension of agreement, or alternatively a levy fee of R750 to replace the existing router,” it said. The once-off installation cost of NeoBroadband fibre remains R1,500. Liquid Telecom will implement the following “soft cap” limits as part of its fair use policy. If you hit the cap, your speed is reset at the start of every month.
