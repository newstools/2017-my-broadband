Fixed LTE-Advanced packages are an attractive option for many South African broadband users, due to a variety of reasons: The recent launch of Rain’s LTE-A network allowed local ISPs to get involved in the wireless-connectivity game, with Webafrica and MWEB launching multiple offerings. These packages joined those from Cell C and Telkom, with the latter seen as the dominant player in the fixed-LTE-A space in South Africa. LTE-A typically offers speeds from 10Mbps up to 100Mbps, depending on the user’s distance from the nearest tower and congestion on the network. Cell C told MyBroadband it has seen speeds of up to 100Mbps on its LTE-A network, and is continuously working to improve its network coverage and capacity. “Our 2017 network roll-out plan is on track and in line with our scheduled timeline. We are always looking at ways to offer our customers the best service and overall value,” said Cell C. If you are looking for an LTE-A package, the table below shows what is on offer from Telkom, Cell C, MWEB, and Webafrica. Users should always consult a provider’s LTE-A coverage map before purchasing a package.
