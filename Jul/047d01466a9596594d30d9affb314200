The estate of JRR Tolkien and Warner Bros. have settled a case over the digital exploitation of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings after five years of litigation, reported Hollywood Reporter. The Tolkien Estate sued Warner Bros. over The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring: Online Slot Game, calling it “highly offensive”. The prospect of everything from online games to housing developments had done irreparable harm to Tolkien’s legacy, it argued. Book publisher HarperCollins and the Tolkien Estate filed an $80-million suit against Warner Bros. in 2012, accusing its subsidiary New Line Cinema of infringing copyright and breaching its contract. They said their agreement only entitled the studio to create tangible merchandise based on the books. Warner Bros. then filed counterclaims, and it was ruled the company could “sue for being sued”. The parties have now reached a settlement agreement after several years of inaction. The terms of the deal have not been made public.
