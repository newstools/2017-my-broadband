Telkom has won a “landmark” court case, with costs, against Vodacom over the unlawful accessing of its infrastructure. The case was resolved in the Western Cape High Court on 26 July 2017, said Telkom. Telkom brought an urgent application against Vodacom relating to Vodacom’s “unlawful use of its infrastructure in the Dennegeur residential estate”. The operator said Vodacom unlawfully accessed its duct infrastructure and requested the court to order Vodacom to remove its cabling from its ducts. The court agreed that the infrastructure in question may not be accessed without companies following prescribed regulatory processes.
