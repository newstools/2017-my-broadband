Facebook has removed the ability of non-publisher Pages to overwrite link metadata in its ongoing battle against fake news. “We’re always working to limit the spread of false news on Facebook to support a more informed community,” Facebook said. “Starting today non-publisher Pages will no longer be able to overwrite link metadata – i.e. headline, description, image – in the Graph API or in Page composer.” Facebook explained that this will help to eliminate a channel that has been abused to post false news. Impacted Pages can still program and preview how their link attachments will appear on Facebook using Open Graph tags and Facebook’s Sharing Debugger. Facebook has also launched a tab in Page Publishing Tools for publishers to indicate link ownership and continue editing how their own links appear on Facebook. “We’re first rolling this feature out to publishers, including news, sports and entertainment pages, because we’ve found that many of these Page types modify links to their own articles at scale,” Facebook said. Pages that abuse the ability to modify their own links in any way will lose access to this tool to overwrite metadata for link previews.
