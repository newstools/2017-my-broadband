A research paper by the American National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that video games are a primary cause of young men working fewer hours. Researchers found that American men aged 31-55 were working 163 hours a year less than the same age group in 2000, and men 21-30 were working 203 fewer hours a year. The paper argues that since 2004, video games have been a major factor in reducing the amount of work done by young men. The researchers found that young men’s leisure time grew by 2.3 hours a week from 2004 to 2015, and the majority of that increase was spent playing video games. Other groups such as older men and young women saw smaller growth in leisure time, with far less of that time spent playing video games.
