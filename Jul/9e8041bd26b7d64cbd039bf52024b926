James Aguma has resigned as acting CEO of the SABC effective immediately, and the SABC while withdraw all disciplinary charges against him, Times Live reported. This follows confusion about his status as the public broadcaster’s chief executive earlier this year when Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo announced that he was no longer its acting CEO. Aguma clarified that he stepped down temporarily due to his poor health and that Tseliso Ralitabo, the SABC’s chief financial officer would act as CEO in his stead. He was facing a disciplinary hearing into his conduct and stood accused of tender irregularities and wasteful expenditure. Aguma was also accused of providing false information under oath during the disciplinary proceedings of former chief operating officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng. Motsoeneng’s appointment at the SABC also featured in the treason charges OUTA filed against former Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi yesterday. In 2015, the Western Cape High Court found that Muthambi acted irrationally and unlawfully in her appointment of Motsoeneng, due to the Public Protector’s findings against him of abuses of power, fraud, and maladministration.
