EOH will continue its expansion into the Middle East and rest of Africa, while growing its footprint in markets such as Western Europe and North America. That’s the word from the new CEO at EOH, Zunaid Mayet, who took over from the company’s founder Asher Bohbot after he stepped aside at the end of June. Mayet said that EOH established its international division roughly two years ago, and has mainly been focusing on the rest of the continent. “The offerings we have are relevant for countries that are in the emerging market,” Mayet told MyBroadband. He said their growth strategy is to identify those markets with similar needs to South Africa and which also have the necessary skills in the country. “There’s no point deploying technology in an organisation in a foreign country where you don’t have the local skills-base to be able to benefit the organisation,” said Mayat. EOH’s is currently growing up into Africa, the Middle-East, and countries like Turkey, and Mayat said they will look at similar markets beyond that, such as South-East Asia. “By the same token, we do have some very mature technology that’s relevant for even the developed world.” In particular, EOH has very niche software that fits particular industries. EOH wants to grow its channel to market for such offerings in Western Europe and North America, Mayat said. Africa Analysis describes EOH as the the most prolific M&A company in the SA ICT sector. During the 2015/16 financial year, EOH acquired Grid Control Technologies and Mehleketo Resourcing. In April 2016, the company acquired Aptronics for R194 million. More recently, EOH announced its plans to acquire Cornastone, subject to regulatory approvals. In the Middle East and Africa, EOH has acquired majority stakes in companies in Morocco, Turkey, Iran, and Mozambique. These companies include:
