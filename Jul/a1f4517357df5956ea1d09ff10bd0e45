Google is bringing Trusted Contacts to iOS, which follows the release of the Trusted Contacts app on Android in December. Trusted Contacts is a personal safety app that opens a line of sharing between a user and their friends and family. Trusted Contacts lets users alert their friends and family to where to find them in an emergency. Even in situations where a user is unable to get their phone, their trusted contacts can find them. “If a friend or family member asks for your location and you don’t respond, your location is automatically shared with your loved one,” said Google. Users can also proactively share their location using the app.
