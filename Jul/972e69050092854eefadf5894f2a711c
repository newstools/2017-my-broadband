WhatsApp’s services are being disrupted in China in the lead up to the 19th Party Congress, where top leadership positions in the Communist Party of the China are determined. The New York Times reported that WhatsApp users found they were unable to send videos, photos, and in some cases even text messages to one another. Nadim Kobeissi, a cryptographer at Symbolic Software, told the Times the block appears to originate from the “Great Firewall”, an Internet filter administered by the government of China. A source also told the publication that the WhatsApp blocks came from the Chinese government. WhatsApp declined to comment on the Times’ story.
