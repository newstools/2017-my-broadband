Facebook has announced plans to expand its main campus, turning it into a mini-neighbourhood. The company originally moved to the Menlo Science and Technology Park in 2011 and is now planning to expand its footprint and rename the location Willow Campus. Facebook said it will work with the community to create a neighbourhood centre which provides services such as a pharmacy, grocery store, and various other community-facing retail stores. Willow Campus will also feature 1,500 new units of housing, 15% of which will be offered at below market rates. The company will file its plans for the new campus later this month and expects construction to begin in two years.
