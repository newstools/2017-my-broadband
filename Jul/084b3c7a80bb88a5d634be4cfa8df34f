Google is increasing its protection against potentially malicious apps by rolling out an “unverified app” screen for newly-created web applications and Apps Scripts that require verification. “In the coming months, we will begin expanding the verification process and the new warnings to existing apps as well,” Google said. The unverified app screen which is rolled out by Google will replace the error page that developers and users of unverified web apps receive today. It will feature bolder warnings to inform users about newly-created web apps and Apps Scripts that are pending verification. “The unverified app screen precedes the permissions consent screen for the app and lets potential users know that the app has yet to be verified,” Google said. Google explained that this will help reduce the risk of user data being phished by bad actors.
