Starting a DIY electronics project is easier than ever thanks to microcontrollers and mini computing boards. Whether you’re creating an IoT hub with wireless connectivity, or a remote-controlled robot, mini computing boards allow you to build almost any gadget. We have listed four mini boards that offer almost limitless possibilities. The Pi is a great starting point for beginners and is useful for software-based projects, due to its linux-based operating system. Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth coupled with 40 GPIO pins make the Pi 3 Model B a great choice for IoT hub devices.  The Arduino ecosystem includes first and third-party boards which are focused on hardware-based electronics projects. The Arduino Uno is technically a microcontroller and features relatively basic specifications with no software overhead.  Gigabyte’s BRIX mini PC is the largest device on this list, and provides desktop-grade power and numerous hardware interfaces.  The Banana Pi is a refined version of the Raspberry Pi, and features a different I/O and support for more operating systems.
