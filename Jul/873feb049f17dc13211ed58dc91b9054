Vodacom has offered the editor of Tuis magazine R26,000 in compensation after criminals conducted an unauthorised SIM swap in a failed attempt to steal R100,000 from his ABSA account in April. The Rapport newspaper stated that the R100,000 transaction was reversed by ABSA after it was flagged by the bank’s security systems. This was partly due to previous fraud on the account. Editor Wicus Pretorius said the problem of SIM-swap fraud should be exposed in full, and he expects large companies like Vodacom to solve a weakness which criminals exploit. Vodacom said the R26,000 offered to Pretorius was a goodwill gesture, following the attempted fraud. “Vodacom considered all aspects of Pretorius’s case, including the outcomes of the investigation as well as his credit history, before making the goodwill offer,” it said. “Each case is different and recommendations will be made based on the case’s merit.” Vodacom said it shows zero tolerance towards any type of illegal activity occurring on its network, and has a dedicated Forensic Services team which investigates all cases of fraud. “Where our investigation positively identifies fraud, the incident is reported to the South African Police Service.” Vodacom said in the event of a SIM-swap request, Vodacom subscribers immediately receive a notification of the pending SIM swap. If a Vodacom subscriber receives an alert and did not request the SIM swap, they must immediately contact Vodacom on 111. “The vast majority of SIM-swap requests are legitimate, with an estimated 0.004% potentially involved in fraudulent banking activities,” said Vodacom. Vodacom has taken a number of proactive measures to combat SIM-swap fraud and has seen “instances of SIM-swap fraud decline markedly in the past year”.
