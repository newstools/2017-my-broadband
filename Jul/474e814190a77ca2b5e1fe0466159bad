Amazon is still investigating the South African market with a view to open a local data centre, according to Amazon CTO Werner Vogels. BusinessLive reported that Amazon Web Services has a large customer base in the country, including young businesses and larger companies, and that Vogels is aware of the importance of the region. Vogels said they have high expectations for growth in South Africa and that a presence in the country would benefit other regions in Africa, too. Michael Needham – Head of Solutions Architecture for CIS, Russia, Middle East, and Africa at Amazon Web Services – told MyBroadband in 2016 that African companies are set to increase their use of Amazon Web Services going forward. Local companies which use AWS include Pick n Pay – in combination with another service provider – for its online shopping platform. The news comes after Microsoft announced it will deliver cloud services from data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town in 2018.
