Elon Musk has shared two images of the first Tesla Model 3 production unit. Musk tweeted earlier that the first production model of the vehicle was being constructed and undergoing a final check beforeÂ posting two photos of the car. Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis had the rights to the first car off the production line, but gave those rights to Musk as a present for his 46th birthday. Production of the Tesla Model 3 is set to ramp up throughout the year, with over 20,000 vehicles expected to roll out by the end of 2017.
