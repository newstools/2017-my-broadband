The ZA Central Registry has announced that domain registrations for the .africa geographic top-level domain are now open to the general public. “Domains are now available for registration on a first-come, first-served basis,” said ZACR CEO Lucky Masilela. DotAfrica’s launch to the general public comes after a sunrise phase, where registered trademark owners were allowed to apply for domain names. This was followed by a landrush phase, which let brand owners, businesses, and the general public register premium .africa domains. Users can register .africa domains through registrars listed on DotAfrica’s registry page.
