Samsung has added support for PayPal as a payment method within the Samsung Pay application. To use the feature,Â Samsung Pay users can add their PayPal account to the app and then spend their available balance. The company said that the partnership lets merchants using Braintree Direct easily integrate Samsung Pay as a payment method with the addition of a few lines of code. PayPal support will be available for all Samsung Pay users in the United States and will expand to other countries soon.
