BBM is in discussions with mobile operators in South Africa regarding subsidised data for its messaging application. This is part of its drive to partner with operators to offer better services for consumers, the CEO of Creative Media Works, Matthew Talbot, told MyBroadband. Creative Media Works, a division of PT Elang Mahkota Teknologi, bought the rights to operate BBM on non-BlackBerry devices in June 2016. Talbot said they hope to create packages for BBM that are similar to the deals BlackBerry had for its devices in South Africa. Deals with operators may comprise subsidised data for messaging, content, and chat bots, but not voice or video calling, said Talbot. This comes after BBM stated it has 2.1 million monthly active users in South Africa (excluding those on BlackBerry OS devices). BBM has launched several new products in South Africa this year, including STAGE360 Music, DiscoverTV, BBM News, and Rewards. The company stated that South Africa is a key growth market for the service, and it sees massive potential in the country. “South Africa has always been a key market for us and we have a loyal and engaged user base here which we intend to grow significantly over the next few years,” Adam Pattison, VP for EMEA at BBM, told MyBroadband earlier in the year.
