DirhamCoin (AED) takes a much greener approach to mining by using the currency itself to perform the task, rather than energy-inefficient ASIC or GPU mining. Contributing to DirhamCoin not only pays back a good return on investment, but will immediately reduce your carbon footprint. This offers a refreshing approach to managing finance and breaks the mould of traditional fiat currencies and banking systems. DirhamCoin is free of interest of any kind and through a reserve, establishes trust via the Blockchain offering several benefits over traditional fiat currencies: Investors are guaranteed a daily increase in AED value of 2%, allowing investors the opportunity to gain return on investment through appreciation as a result of its fixed supply, increased demand and DirhamCoinâ€™s mission of making the world a greener place. This is done by means of building Greenhouses as well as allowing our coin holders to vote on how the money is spent. Holding 10,000AED to 45,000 AED in a DirhamCoin wallet transforms the wallet into a Green Master Reserve Node. Nodes with 10,000 to 15,000 AED position the owner to obtain voting rights, helping to steer the direction of DirhamCoin. Nodes with 25,000 to 35,000 influence decisions in the same way an individual does on a board of directors and instantly qualifies for entry to the DirhamCoin Foundation. A limited supply of AED will be available each day, with only about 26 million AED to be distributed, and no mined AED will be held by the development team after the ICO.
