RocketNet has launched its uncapped fibre-to-the-home packages on Vumatel’s network. Directel launched the Internet service provider in February 2016, using Workonline Communications as its upstream international bandwidth provider. RocketNet was initially only available on MetroFibre Networx’s fibre network infrastructure, but has since expanded to Fibrehoods, Frogfoot, and Mitsol. It launched packages on SA Digital Villages in November and on Vumatel on 15 July. It offers aggressively-priced deals on all of the networks it runs on, including an uncapped symmetrical 100Mbps service on Frogfoot and Mitsol for R995 per month. Packages all run on a month-to-month basis and include a free Wi-Fi router, with most also including free setup. RocketNet’s offerings exclude the Vumatel install fee. RocketNet’s uncapped package prices are summarised in the table below:
