Tech professionals looking for a job are in for a pleasant surprise from local talent marketplace OfferZen: The company has expanded its placement offering to include additional areas of expertise including data science, UI/UX design, product management and more. Leaving the sole focus on software developers behind, OfferZen wants to become the single source of tech talent for South African companies. “We are super excited about this big change,” says co-founder Philip Joubert. “Since our launch, we’ve had to turn away thousands of excellent people in many of these roles,” he continues. Now employers will be able to hire their entire tech team through OfferZen’s marketplace: After founding several other startups like SnapScan and Luno, co-founders Philip and Malan Joubert knew that building great software required more than just people who write the code. “We realized that, if we’re serious about supporting local tech products, we needed to expand our platform to cater for everyone involved in building modern software,” Malan says. Less than 2 years into operation, OfferZen’s platform is already being used by almost 600 companies including big-names like GetSmarter, Takealot, Barclays, Old Mutual, Allan Gray and 24.com, as well as a host of successful startups like SweepSouth and Yoco. These companies are looking to fill an increasing amount of tech positions in their teams. That’s why Lungisa Matshoba, Co-founder & CTO at Yoco, is excited about OfferZen’s big announcement: “Working with OfferZen has been an amazing experience. Instant access to top candidates has made our hiring process much faster – and I’d recommend them to anyone looking to build a world-class tech team.” To sign up to OfferZen and start receiving interview requests with upfront salary details, click here.
