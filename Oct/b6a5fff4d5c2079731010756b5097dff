Microsoft is discontinuing Music Pass support in Groove and music purchases in the Windows Store. The Groove Music app will continue to support playback and music management of owned content. The company is also expanding its partnership with Spotify to bring the streaming service to Groove Music Pass customers. Beginning this week, Groove Music Pass customers can move their curated playlists and collections into Spotify. “Plus, you may be eligible for a 60-day free trial of Spotify Premium,” said Microsoft. Microsoft said it will continue to invest in and update the Groove Music app on Windows to support playback and management of owned music. After 31 December 2017, however, the Groove Music app will no longer offer the option to stream, purchase, or download music.
