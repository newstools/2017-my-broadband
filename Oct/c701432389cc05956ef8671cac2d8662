MyBroadband has tested mobile data speeds inside Gautengâ€™s biggest shopping malls, which showed that Vodacom and MTN provide the best performance. MyBroadband performed thousands of download, upload, and latency tests in the malls using test benches running the MyBroadband Android Speed Test App. The research was completed between 1-10 October, with tests conducted throughout the shopping malls to ensure accurate results. The results showed that Vodacom and MTN had the best performance and the best coverage in the malls. Vodacom recorded the highest average performance in 8 malls, with MTN winning 6 malls, Cell C winning 2, and Rain topping the results in 1 mall. The highest recorded peak speed was in Brooklyn Mall, with Vodacom producing a download speed of 172Mbps. The tests further showed that the malls had excellent LTE coverage from all the operators, with average speeds often exceeding 40Mbps. The tables below provide an overview of the speed test results. The tables below show how the operators performed in each shopping mall. Each red dot with a green circle around it indicates a single speed test. The red dots get bigger when multiple tests are performed in close proximity.
