Intel recently launched its new generation of Core desktop processors, offering increased physical core counts and higher clock speeds. The new chips use the LGA 1151 socket – like Intel’s Skylake and Kaby Lake chips – but are not supported by older chipsets. This means that if you want to upgrade to an 8th-gen Core i3, i5, or i7 desktop processor, you must buy a new motherboard. Currently, the only 300-series motherboards available are the Z370 high-end boards – which support overclocking and features aimed at enthusiasts. More 300-series motherboards are expected to launch in the coming months. Pricing for the Z370 boards from ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI, and ASRock available in South Africa is listed below.
