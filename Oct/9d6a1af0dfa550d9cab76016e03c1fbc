New data from online jobs portal Adzuna has provided insight into the most sought-after skills in South Africa. Adzuna looked at the listed requirements in over 130,000 job listings, assessing the demand for a particular skill versus job seekers looking for jobs in that field. The company then combined these factors to reveal the “rarest” skills in the country – defined by the “Rareness Factor”. A factor of 2.0, for example, means there are twice as many vacancies as job seekers looking for those positions. If a skill is in high demand but low in supply, this makes it rare. Many of 2016’s rarest job skills have remained at the top of the list in 2017 – particularly in the field of software development. Java and PHP developers are in great demand, but in low supply, while other tech positions make up seven of the top 10 rarest job skills. The rarity of the skills listed by Adzuna also correlates to average salaries, with rare skills generally attracting higher salaries. This isn’t true across the board, however. For example, engineering jobs have some of the highest salaries listed, but carry a rareness factor of 5.0. The table below lists the 10 rarest IT skills in South Africa as of September 2017, as well as the average salaries listed for the positions. Green numerals indicate the skill has become rarer since 2016, while red indicates the skill’s rareness factor has dropped.
