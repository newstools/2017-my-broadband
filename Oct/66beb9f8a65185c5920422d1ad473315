Vodacom is currently trialling URL social media bundles for Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest, the network told MyBroadband. The trial follows the company’s MegYourDay promotion, which gave prepaid, contract, and hybrid plan subscribers free data for certain services. The services included Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram. New bundles seen by MyBroadband were daily bundles – expiring at the end of their day of purchase – and let users purchase access to YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. If the trial is successful, a commercial launch will be announced, said Vodacom.
