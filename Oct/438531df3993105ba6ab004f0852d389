HeroTel has acquired Internet Generation (IGEN Wireless) for an undisclosed sum, expanding its footprint in the Eastern Cape. IGEN provides wireless services to over 7,000 clients across the Eastern Cape and is one of the largest WISPs in South Africa. “With the addition of IGEN to the family, HeroTel has contiguous coverage from the West Coast to the Kei River,” said HeroTel chairman Alan Knott-Craig Jnr. HeroTel said it would leave the company’s management intact following the acquisition. IGEN general manager Wanti du Preez said the company is excited to join HeroTel and work towards building a national WISP. HeroTel said it would have 30,000 clients across its WISPs by the end of 2017, and plans to double its coverage by the end of 2018.
