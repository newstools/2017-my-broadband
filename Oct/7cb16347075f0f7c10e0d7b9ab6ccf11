Apple has released iTunes 12.6.3, which brings back App Store apps and ringtone downloads to the desktop, reported MacRumors. Apple said it offers volume purchase programmes and the Apple Configurator on Mac for enterprise environments to manage apps on iOS devices, but this doesn’t address the needs of all clients. “Certain business partners might still need to use iTunes to install apps,” said Apple. If you have installed a newer version of iTunes, you can download and install this version of iTunes on your Mac or PC to deploy apps with iTunes. “You won’t be prompted to download new versions of iTunes after you install this version,” said Apple. When you are ready to upgrade, you will have to do so manually.
