MyBroadband recently conducted mobile network drive tests in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo, which showed that Vodacom has the best network in these regions. The tests were conducted between 21-25 September, using a test bench with five Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphones running the MyBroadband Speed Test App. Speed tests were conducted at regular intervals on a route through rural areas and larger towns and cities in the provinces. Over 2,500 speed tests were conducted on Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, Telkom, and Rain’s networks over the five days. The results showed that Vodacom and MTN had the best coverage, with a higher number of successful tests than their competitors. Vodacom also produced the highest average download speed, which is impressive considering it had the highest number of tests in rural areas without LTE coverage. Rain was the biggest surprise. The operator had good coverage in most cities and towns which we visited, and its LTE-A network produced a solid performance. The table below provides an overview of the results of the MyBroadband drive tests in Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Limpopo. It should be noted that only providing an average download speed per network is not a fair measure, as it disadvantages operators with good 3G coverage in rural areas – like Vodacom and MTN. To overcome this problem, we have included a peak performance comparison – where the top 350 speed tests for each operator was used. The maps below show where MyBroadband conducted its drive tests.              The individual test maps for each operator, below, show the coverage in the areas where MyBroadband conducted its tests.
