Severe weather in Gauteng has affected MTN infrastructure across the province. A storm caused power outages across Gauteng, and many MTN sites lost power and connectivity as a result. MTN has deployed engineers to restore connectivity and power to affected sites, but approximately 80 sites remain without power. “MTN South Africa is working diligently to restore services to customers affected by this ferocious storm,” it said. Most of MTN’s transmission and radio networks are equipped with battery backups or generators, but these are short-term solutions.
