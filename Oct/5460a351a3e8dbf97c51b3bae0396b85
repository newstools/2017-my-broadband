Valve has licensed more of its virtual reality technology to hardware manufacturers, reported Tom’s Hardware. The company previously supplied hardware manufacturers with its room-scale tracking technology at no cost, and now offers access to its optical system technology, manufacturing and calibration tools, and software stack. Valve’s custom lenses will also be made available for purchase for use in SteamVR-compatible headsets. SteamVR is Valve’s dedicated VR platform, which currently boasts over 2,000 compatible titles and supports a number of headsets. The report stated that Valve is also working with Microsoft to make Windows Mixed Reality headsets compatible with SteamVR.
