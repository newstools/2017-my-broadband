Sony’s PlayStation division has launched a credit card in the US. The PlayStation Credit Card features rewards “designed with gamers in mind”. This includes a $50 PlayStation Store code after your first purchase using the card. Users can also earn Sony Rewards points on purchases from the PlayStation Store, on PlayStation and Sony purchases at authorised retailers, and when paying their mobile phone bill. 100 points is like $1 in Sony Rewards, said the company. The card does not have an annual fee and multiple game-inspired designs are available.
