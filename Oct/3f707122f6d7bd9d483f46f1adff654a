Orange is set to launch an online banking service on 2 November, reported Reuters. It was originally set for a launch on 6 July, but Orange postponed it to extend and broaden the test phase, stated the report. The bank will offer an instant, secure mobile payment service and a free debit card. It will also have an app that lets clients transfer money to other Orange accounts by text message. According to the report, Orange’s plans show that mobile operators are seeing increased smartphone adoption and a decline in the use of bank branches as an opportunity to take on financial service providers.
