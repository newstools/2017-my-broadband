The 2017 MyBroadband Cryptocurrency Survey shows that Ethereum is the favourite currency of South African miners. The survey was completed by 1,598 people, the majority of whom were IT professionals and tech-savvy individuals. While 53.57% of respondents said they owned cryptocurrency, the percentage of people with crypto-mining rigs was much lower – 14.77%. This shows that relative to owning cryptocurrency, crypto-mining is a niche venture in the local tech space. Of those who owned a crypto-mining rig, Ethereum was the most popular currency to mine. Ethereum (51.27%), beat Bitcoin mining via a GPU NiceHash miner (35.59%), and Zcash mining (17.80%). Bitcoin mining via an ASIC miner came in at 16.53%. The graphic below details the results of the survey. It must be noted that respondents were allowed to select multiple answers for certain questions.
