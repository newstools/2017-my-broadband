The SA Post Office has announced that customers who renew their postboxes before the end of 2017 will qualify for a free digital postbox for life. A digital postbox is a platform where users can send and receive eRegistered and confidential mail electronically. eRegistered mail is the “Legislated Electronic Registered Mail of South Africa”, and has the same legal status as the current physical registered mail. Where the law requires documents to be delivered by registered mail, doing so via eRegistered mail will suffice. The digital postbox is a “highly-secure communication platform for sending and receiving electronic mail”, and offers an encrypted vault for storing electronic documents. Safe payment options for paying accounts are also available. A year’s rental for a postbox is R450, and R1,800 for a private bag.
