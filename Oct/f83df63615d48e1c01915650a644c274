Many existing data centres utilise the same power distribution architecture to get power to their IT equipment that was developed for data centres approximately 40 years ago. There have been dramatic changes, however, in how power is utilized in data centres that have challenged this architecture, specifically driven by: Improved systems allow IT racks to be installed or changed without any new wiring, distribute power overhead, support rack densities up to 30 kW with a single flexible power feed, improve electrical efficiency, are instrumented for power at the branch circuit, and have a standard capacity management system. As a result, significant improvements in efficiency, power density, power monitoring, and reconfigurability have been achieved in data centre power distribution, increasing the options available for data centres. Schneider Electricâ€™s white paper compares five power distribution approaches, including their advantages and disadvantages, and provided guidelines for when each is optimal. The five approaches include: Guidance is provided on selecting the best approach for specific applications and constraints. To download the whitepaper, visit the Schneider Electric website.
