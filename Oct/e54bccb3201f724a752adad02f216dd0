Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 –  $555.99 with coupon code: GBZAMIMIX2 for the first 10 pieces sold.  The Chinese giant has recently launched its second iteration of the Mi Mix Phablet. Xiaomi gave the world a taste of what was to come in smartphone design when it released the first Mi Mix model with a large, gorgeous display with its next to no bezels design. This, of course, led to almost every major manufacturer to follow their lead in cutting out unused surface area. And as with its predecessor, the Mi Mix 2’s screen attracts all the initial attention. The screen measures 5.99 inches, and has an 18:9 aspect ratio, which is shared by the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8. Other attractive features of the Mi MIX 2 include a fingerprint sensor, dual SIM, 4G LTE, Wi-Fi ac dual band, Bluetooth 5.0, a USB Type C port and support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.
