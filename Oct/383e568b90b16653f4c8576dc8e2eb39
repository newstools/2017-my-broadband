Windows 10 users on the Insider Program have reported that the latest update to the OS removes Windows Media Player. According to BetaNews, the removal of the media player may be due to the abundance of high-quality third-party alternatives – including VLC Media Player. “The feature’s removal came to light when users installed KB4046355 on devices running Windows 10 version 1709 – the Fall Creators Update,” stated the report. While the media player is removed from the OS, it is not completely binned. The report stated that users can reinstall the player via the Add a Feature setting. Microsoft had not replied to requests for comment.
