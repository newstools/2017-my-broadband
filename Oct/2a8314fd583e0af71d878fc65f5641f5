Facebook Inc. is making a series of changes to its advertising systems and plans to add more than 1,000 people to review the advertisements that run on the social media platform in the wake of a congressional investigation into Russia’s involvement in the 2016 U.S. election. Additionally, Facebook said Monday it provided information on about 3,000 relevant ads to congressional investigators. In September, the social media giant disclosed that accounts affiliated with Russia bought more than $100,000 in election-related ads. That disclosure prompted a congressional probe, which now includes Twitter Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. The companies have been asked to testify before the Senate on Nov. 1. Two weeks ago, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced an overhaul to the rules around political ad spending and said the company would add 250 employees to work on election integrity. “I don’t want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy,” Zuckerberg said in a video message. On Monday, the company said it was bulking up the staff that review ad spending, although it declined to offer details on the process. Facebook also introduced several updates to the ad-buying process, including tighter restrictions on content and improved rules to force advertisers to demonstrate their authenticity before they can make purchases. U.S. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been critical of Facebook and Twitter for the information the companies have shared with lawmakers thus far. Last week, Warner said that Facebook’s disclosure about ad buys tied to Russia was insufficient.
