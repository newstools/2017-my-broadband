Afrihost recently launched a Rain LTE-A 25GB+25GB package for R299 per month. The package benefits from Rain’s double-data promotion – running until the end of November – which means users receive 50GB of anytime data. Afrihost also announced it will provide the Huawei B618 LTE-A router that comes with Rain packages for free. Webafrica launched a similar deal recently, requiring users to return the router if they cancel the Rain service. The “50GB” Rain data package competes against similar offerings from Cell C and Telkom. Cell C recently launched a promotion on its LTE-A packages, which are valid until December 2017, but which exclude a router. Telkom introduced an LTE double-data promotion in September, and recently launched a 20GB anytime + 20GB Night Surfer package as its October Big Deal. Subscribers who take up the Telkom double-data deal before the end of January 2018 will receive double their data allocation for the duration of their contract. The contracts also include a free Huawei B315 LTE Wi-Fi router. The table below shows how the new 25GB+25GB Rain offering compares against similar products from Cell C and Telkom.
