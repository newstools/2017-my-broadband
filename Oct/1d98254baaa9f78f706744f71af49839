Tesla has missed its target of producing over 1,500 Model 3 cars by September, The Wall Street Journal reported. Elon Musk tweeted in July he expected the company to deliver 100 cars in August, and over 1,500 the following month. “Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in December,” said Musk. Tesla has only produced 260 Model 3 cars, however, 220 of which have been delivered. Tesla said that production bottlenecks in a handful of manufacturing systems at its California plant and Gigafactory in Nevada caused the poor start. “It is important to emphasise that there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain,” said Tesla. “We understand what needs to be fixed and we are confident of addressing the manufacturing bottleneck issues.”
