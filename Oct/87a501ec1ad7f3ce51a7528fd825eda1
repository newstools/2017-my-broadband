Twitter plans to launch a tool for users to bookmark tweets, said product manager Jesar Shah. The feature provides users with a list of tweets they can refer to at a later stage without having to favourite them. “Many of you, especially in Japan, have said you’d like to be able to easily and privately save tweets for later,” said Shah. “Right now, people bookmark Tweets by liking, DMing to themselves, or Retweeting. But this could be easier.” Twitter told TechCrunch it will launch the feature to users soon.
