King Price has launched Cybersure, an information security insurance product for business. Cybersure covers computer systems, software, and data, and protects businesses against liability arising from attacks on its information systems. It includes cover for cyber liability and cybercrime, data breach expenses, damage to computer systems and data, associated loss of income, and more. King Price also plans to launch a personal cyber insurance product in early 2018. As part of the launch, King Price is running a competition where it will give away R1 million in Bitcoin. From 8 October to 28 February 2018, users can enter by playing a game hosted on the Cybersure website. Eight finalists will be selected and play a knockout round to determine the three winners.
