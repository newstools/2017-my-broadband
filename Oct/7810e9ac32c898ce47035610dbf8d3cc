WhatsApp has unveiled a new emoji set, which is available in the beta release of WhatsApp for Android. Emojipedia has reported that WhatsApp is following the lead of Facebook and Twitter by making their own emoji available to app users. This follows a long history of WhatsApp using Apple’s emoji on its platforms, which included its Android app and web client. The new WhatsApp emoji look similar to Apple’s, with Emojipedia explaining that WhatsApp took Apple’s emojis “and changed them enough so we can call them our own”.
