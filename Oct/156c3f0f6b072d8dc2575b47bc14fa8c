Samsung may make more money from supplying parts for Apple’s iPhone X than from its Galaxy S8 smartphone, according to The Wall Street Journal. Samsung stands to make $110 in profit for each iPhone X sold, stated the report. A contributing factor to this is the iPhone X’s inclusion of a Samsung-made OLED display, along with its use of Samsung NAND flash memory and DRAM chips. Counterpoint Technology predicts that Apple will sell 130 million iPhone X units in 20 months, and Samsung will make around $14.3 billion from this. The report stated that Samsung makes $202 for each Galaxy S8 it sells, and 50 million Galaxy S8 smartphones are expected to be sold within 20 months of its launch. Samsung is the largest manufacturer of OLED displays in the world, and is currently the only company which can meet Apple’s demands.
