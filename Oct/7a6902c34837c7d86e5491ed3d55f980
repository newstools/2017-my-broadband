Microsoft has announced a new wind energy agreement in Ireland, which sees the companyÂ entering a 15-year power purchase agreement with GE. Microsoft will purchase 100% of the wind energy from its new 37-megawatt Tullahennel wind farm in County Kerry. Microsoft has also signed an agreement with Dublin-based energy trading company ElectroRoute, which will provide energy trading services to Microsoft. In addition to producing energy, the project will provide valuable data on energy storage. Each turbine has an integrated battery, and Microsoft and GE will test how these batteries can be used to capture and store excess energy. This provides more predictable power to the grid by smoothing out peaks in wind production. It is the first deployment of battery integration in wind turbines in Europe.
