Skype is bringing Cortana, Microsoft’s intelligent assistant, to its platform. “With Cortana’s in-context assistance, it’s easier to keep your conversations going by having Cortana suggest useful information based on your chat,” said Skype. Cortana also suggests smart replies, allowing users to respond to a message quickly without typing, and helps users to organise their day. Cortana can detect when a user is talking about scheduling events, and will recommend setting a reminder on all their devices that have Cortana. Cortana in Skype will initially roll out to Android and iOS customers in the US.
