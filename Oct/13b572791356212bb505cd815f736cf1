ICASA has published its biannual report on tariff notifications submitted to it by network operators. The report, for 1 January 2017 to 30 June 2017, includes data price benchmarking between the cheapest 500MB and 2GB bundles in South Africa, and those of several African countries. ICASA focused on the SADC region, where South African mobile networks have a footprint. Factors such as coverage, service quality, technology type, and the price of mobile devices were not taken into account, it said. Prices in local currencies were converted to US dollars using the average exchange rate at the time of the comparison. South Africa ranked 14 out of 19 countries in terms of offering the cheapest 500MB data bundles. Swaziland offered the most expensive 500MB data bundle, while Morocco had the cheapest – at $0.50. South Africa’s cheapest 500MB data bundle was approximately three-times cheaper than Swaziland’s, but 10-times more expensive than Morocco’s.  On average, the prices of 2GB bundles from the countries were higher than those of Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom Mobile. However, ICASA said it found a few instances where operators in Mauritius, Malawi, Mozambique, and Tanzania are cheaper than South African operators – up to 80% in certain cases.
