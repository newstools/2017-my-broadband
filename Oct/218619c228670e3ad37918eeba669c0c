A study by Telsyte has revealed that Windows tablet sales are catching up to Android tablets. The study focused on the Australian market, and found that Microsoft’s OS could overtake Android in the tablet market before the end of 2017. As shown below, Windows tablets made up 22% of the Australian tablet market in H1 2017, behind Android on 29% and Apple’s iOS on 49%. “Android tablet sales declined by 29% compared to the first half of 2016, with many manufactures holding back the release of new Android tablets,” stated the report. “Windows-based devices from a range of manufacturers have clearly benefited from the merging of PC and tablet features.”
