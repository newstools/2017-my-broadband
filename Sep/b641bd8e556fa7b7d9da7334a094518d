redPanda Software has grown steadily over the last eight years and with nearly a decade of experience in developing retail and financial software, they have grown from 40 staff to just over 120, with their revenue and customer base growing in line with this. “The backbone to our global success has always been based on making sure we have the right capacity and training in place,” says Gareth Hawkey, CEO of redPanda Software. “When looking at international growth, we found that the UK was a clear fit for a South African software development company: we speak the same language, operate in the same time zone and have similar business cultures.”  In 2016, redPanda Software partnered with a global supplier of point of sale (POS) solutions with a head office in the UK, to provide software development services to their core development group. redPanda Software was chosen for their unrivalled expertise and track record in the retail industry, and as the company’s development partner, will be assisting with development projects for local and international customers. “We are very proud of our growth into the UK market as it is not only beneficial to the business, but also to the wider South African IT job market. With this partnership, we can create new job opportunities to widen the pool of software development work for IT professionals in the country,” adds Hawkey. redPanda Software is an expert in end-to-end custom software development.
