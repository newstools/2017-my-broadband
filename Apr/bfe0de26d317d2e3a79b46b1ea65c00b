Business drivers such as cloud migration and a number of issues with MPLS are forcing companies to re-evaluate their WAN design and deployment and look for opportunities for improvement. Large enterprises in South Africa need to come to grips with the full range of benefits, and new business opportunities that are opening up by turning to SD-WAN. Growing companies, with branches opening up across geographic regions, coupled with a dispersed workforce require faster deployments than MPLS can deliver. With that in mind, cost effective bandwidth is required to deliver fast access, reliable and high performing visibility and control. In this digital era, it is important for companies to ask whether MPLS is helping or hindering future growth within their business. SD-WAN goes further from WAN optimisation by selecting a more cost-efficient assortment of public Internet connections and private links. SD-WAN also allows companies to regain control of their wide area network and Internet connectivity, deploy and configure or re-deploy a site within minutes, and obtain insight into the network as to which users and applications are consuming resources and to prioritise, block or throttle traffic. Companies that continue to resist change may not only end up spending more than necessary on legacy networks but also face being leapfrogged by competitors using SD-WAN to enable new digital strategies and provide better customer experiences. Why you should switch to SD-WAN now: Businesses see the value, with SD-WAN providing increased bandwidth at a lower cost, while also enabling them to reduce overall operational expenditure. It is time for businesses to take control of their networks and gain scalability, insight, cost-saving, bandwidth and ultimately future growth.
