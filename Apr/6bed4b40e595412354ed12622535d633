Google plans to launch Hire, which will enable companies to post jobs, and accept and manage applications. The Google Hire website is live, with a sign-in page open to the public, but is yet to launch. According to Axios, “several tech companies seem to be using or testing Google Hire, including Medisas, Poynt, DramaFever, SingleHop, and CoreOS”. “Google Hire seems to be the latest project under Google’s enterprise and cloud division, led by Diane Greene,” said Axios. A Google spokesperson told TechRadar that Hire will allow employers to collect candidate applications online. “Only information that a candidate voluntarily provides would be passed to a prospective employer as part of their online application,” said Google. This debunks rumours that applications through Google Hire will allow employers to view the search history of candidates. There is currently no launch date for the service.
