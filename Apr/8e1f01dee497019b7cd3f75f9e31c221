DeepMind’s AlphaGo will take on the world’s number one Go player Ke Jie in a three-game match from 23 May. “We’re on a scientific mission to push the boundaries of AI, developing programs that can learn to solve any complex problem without needing to be taught how,” said DeepMind. Last month, DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated one of the world’s top Go players, Lee Sedol. “Instead of diminishing the game, as some feared, artificial intelligence has actually made human players stronger and more creative.” To further improve, DeepMind will collaborate with the China Go Association to bring AlphaGo, China’s top Go players, and leading AI experts from Google and China together. The “Future of Go Summit” will be hosted in Wuzhen, where the main attraction will be the match between AlphaGo and Jie. There will also be a game between AlphaGo and a five-player team consisting of China’s top pros.
