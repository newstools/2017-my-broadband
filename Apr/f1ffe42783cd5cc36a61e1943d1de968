Following our investigation into incorrectly-labelled “Full HD” TVs in South Africa, many readers contacted us with information and requests for our testing to be expanded. EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) testing showed that multiple JVC and Telefunken TVs sold at retailers like Game were marketed as Full HD, but did not contain Full HD – 1,920 x 1,080 – panels. Game’s parent company Massmart quarantined the affected stock after conducting its own investigation, while the distributor Nu-World Industries and the National Consumer Commission will decide the way forward in terms of a potential recall. MyBroadband has continued its investigation and testing of more TV makes and models, with Makro and Sinotec the next store/brand combination on the list. MyBroadband visited Makro Centurion and conducted EDID tests on five Sinotec TVs – all of which showed they had the maximum resolutions that they advertised. The Sinotec TVs which were tested and passed were: A special mention must go out to the staff working in Makro’s TV section – all were very helpful and ready to provide assistance when asked.
