Intel has cancelled the 2017 Intel Developer Forum (IDF) set to be held in San Francisco, announcing it will retire the annual event entirely. “Intel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum,” it said. Intel said there are a number of resources available on its website, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. “As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.”
