Google has unveiled the next-generation Jump camera, the YI HALO. The company also launched the Jump Start programme, which will “get Jump cameras into the hands of more filmmakers”. The camera is aimed at the VR industry, and is built by Google in partnership with YI Technology. “YI HALO makes production easier than ever for VR filmmakers. It has 17 4K unit cameras, including an optimally-placed Up camera, to capture immersive scenes that transport viewers,” said Google. The internal battery lasts for 100 minutes of continuous shooting and the unit supports an Android app which doubles as a remote control and live preview tool. The YI HALO will go on sale later in 2017, with units “available today to select creators”. “Interested creators can find more info on the YI HALO website.”
