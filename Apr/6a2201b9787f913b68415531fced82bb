Netflix recently changed the way its shows are rated, dropping the “5-star” system for a “thumbs” replacement. “A thumbs-up tells Netflix that you like something and want to see similar suggestions. A thumbs-down lets us know you aren’t interested in watching that title and we should stop suggesting it to you,” said Netflix. “The star rating you see next to each title is being replaced with a personalised % Match score.” The score is a prediction of what Netflix “thinks you may enjoy watching, based on your own unique tastes”. Following the change, users have reported discrepancies in how shows are “matched” to them. A MyBroadband employee, for example, was previously shown a particular comedy special as having a rating of 1 star. Following the system change, that show was then shown as an 88% match. Netflix told MyBroadband it is aware of an issue with the way previous star ratings are impacting the new percentage match scores. “We are working on resolving this issue as soon as possible,” said the company.
