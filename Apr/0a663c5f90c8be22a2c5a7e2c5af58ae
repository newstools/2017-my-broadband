The inventor of BitTorrent, Bram Cohen, recently presented a paper at Stanford’s blockchain conference in which he argued that Bitcoin is wasteful, TorrentFreak reported. In his paper, he discussed “proofs of space and proofs of time”, proposing a cryptocurrency that pins the mining value to storage space instead of processor time. Cohen told TorrentFreak that his proposal isn’t aimed at changing Bitcoin, but rather a new currency. “I’m going to make a cryptocurrency company. That’s my plan,” said Cohen.
