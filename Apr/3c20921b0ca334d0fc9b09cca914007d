Samsung revealed its Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ smartphones last week, which have received praise from the industry. The devices are set to launch in South Africa on 5 May, and will sell for R15,499 and R17,499 respectively. Samsung has gone for huge screens on the devices, with the S8 featuring a 5.8-inch display and the S8+ sporting a 6.2-inch display – both with a resolution of 2,960 x 1,440. To put this into perspective, the iPhone 7 features a 4.7-inch display, while the iPhone 7 Plus has a 5.5-inch screen. Samsung said its new smartphones feature “groundbreaking” technology which creates a “new paradigm for the mobile experience”. It listed eight “truly innovative” features of the S8 range following the launch event – as detailed below. With the Galaxy S8 just launching and the iPhone 7 having been in the market for a few months, there is a notable price difference in South Africa. The Galaxy S8 (64GB) will sell for R15,499, while an iPhone 7 (32GB) is currently selling for R11,999. Price differences for the larger models are similarly high, with the S8+ costing over R3,000 more than the entry-level 7 Plus. This means that while the Galaxy S8 wins in the “latest tech” category – and the specifications category, as detailed below – the iPhone is a more affordable purchase. The S8 also features Android 7, Google’s latest mobile operating system. For Android fans, it does not get much better than this. For iOS lovers looking for a new device, you have two choices: get an iPhone 7 now or wait until around September and hope Apple sticks to its new device launch schedule. The table below compares the stats of the new Galaxy and the latest iPhone. On paper, the S8 and S8+ are superior, but, as Apple device owners will attest, it is not often an iPhone feels like it is lacking firepower.   Let’s be honest: if you are an Apple/iOS fan, you are getting an iPhone. If you are an Android/Samsung fan, you have already placed a preorder for the S8.
