Vox CEO Jacques du Toit believes that within five years, broadband services which run on Telkom’s DSL infrastructure will no longer exist. Speaking to TechCentral, Du Toit said Telkom is “doing nothing” to maintain ADSL in South Africa and is replacing it with fibre services. “I think five years is a push,” he said. A recent report from Point Topic showed that fibre is killing ADSL everywhere in the world except Africa. According to the report, the number of copper lines globally fell by 11.6% year-on-year, while FTTH connections increased by 76.9% between Q3 2015 and Q3 2016. However, where the share of copper-based technologies (DSL, ADSL, and ADSL2+) in the total subscriber figure continued to fall elsewhere in the world, it made up almost the entire market in Africa. In South Africa, FTTH continues to be cheaper than DSL services and offers the option of a naked broadband service. Internet service providers are also reporting encouraging numbers for their fibre broadband roll-outs, with Du Toit telling MyBroadband at the end of 2016 that they saw an average of 700 new FTTH customers per month. By the end of 2016, Vox, through subsidiary Frogfoot, had passed over 56,000 homes and over 8,000 fibre-to-the-building sites.
