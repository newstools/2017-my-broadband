Google has launched location search in the virtual reality version of Google Earth. “When we first launched Google Earth VR, we knew there was something powerful about being able to point anywhere in the world and start flying,” said Google. It has also added 27 new locations from around the world, one of which is Table Mountain in Cape Town. A version of Google Earth VR for Oculus Rift with support for Oculus Touch controllers has also been launched on the Oculus Store and Steam.
