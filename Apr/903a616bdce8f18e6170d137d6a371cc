IBM’s Watson AI now offers IT support for businesses using the company’s workplace support services. Watson can assist employees with numerous IT issues via a text chat interface. The service can learn from responses and feedback, and can customise its interaction with the user depending on their level of IT knowledge. Watson is available for IT support from any Internet-connected device, reducing downtime due to IT problems. If Watson is unable to solve a problem, it will transfer the user to a human IT professional. A demo of IBM’s workplace support services with Watson is below.
