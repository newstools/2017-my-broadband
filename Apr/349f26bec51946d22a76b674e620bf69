Gijima CEO Eileen Wilton has resigned after almost five years with the company, reported ITWeb. The report stated that Wilton left the company on good terms and would remain active for consultations in the future. The company’s financial situation greatly improved under Wilton, following its delisting from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in May 2015. Wilton first joined Gijima in 2012 and was officially appointed CEO in October 2013. Following her appointment, Wilton headed up a three-year turnaround plan for improving the profitability of Gijima – which consisted of multiple retrenchments and efficiency improvements.
