Google has announced that it will translate foreign language reviews into the language you’ve set on your device. “When you’re travelling somewhere new, two of your biggest challenges can be figuring out where to go and understanding the native language of wherever you are,” it said. “The next time you’re in a foreign place and want to check out a restaurant or point of interest, Google will translate the review into the language you’ve set on your device.” This is an automated service, with the reviews automatically translated. Users will see the translated review in the language they prefer and then see the review in the native language below.
