You may have never seen it, but it turns out YouTube has a secret dark mode – and you can activate it too. “Press Ctrl+Shift+I on the YouTube homepage to open developer window. Go to Application tab, and on the sidebar, go to Cookies>https://www.youtube.com,” he said. “In the table that opens there should be a row named ‘VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE’, double click the ‘value’ cell and replace it with this code: fPQ4jCL6EiE then press enter.” “Refresh the page, if the new layout is enabled, go to your avatar, and from the menu there should be a dark mode toggle.” Here is a step-by-step guide, courtesy of Slashdot: According to The Next Web, the secret dark mode is only available on Chrome 57 and above.
