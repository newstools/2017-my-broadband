Vodacom has launched a new promotion that offers “Double Your Data” when you buy a data bundle through the My Vodacom smartphone app. The free data is valid for seven days and, according to an advert on Vodacom’s YouTube channel, the data may take 24 hours to reflect on your account. Only subscribers on prepaid, or certain contract or hybrid packages, qualify for the promotion – provided they buy their data bundle through the app. Recurring bundles, or bundles that are part of existing packages, do not qualify. The T&C’s on the Vodacom site also list the following exclusions: Vodacom said the 10GB and 20GB bundles will not be available for purchase by post-paid customers on the My Vodacom App. Similarly, 15MB and 30MB bundles are not available for purchase by contract customers on the My Vodacom App. The promotion is set to run from 8 April to 30 June, though Vodacom said it may amend the termination date.
