A new project will revive the classic ZX Spectrum – producing an enhanced version called the ZX Spectrum Next. The Next is fully compatible with the original, which is considered one of the world’s classic computers. Affectionately known as the Speccy, the ZX Spectrum featured a design where its components were placed inside a keyboard. It is still alive after decades, with new games launched for it regularly. Hardware hackers have also expanded the ZX Spectrum to support SD card storage, new video modes, more memory, and a faster processor. The Spectrum Next builds on these enhancements and features a design by the original designer, Rick Dickinson. “You can play any games, demos, and use original hardware. It also runs new software created more recently to make use of expanded hardware, including new graphics modes and faster processor speeds,” said the project team. The ZX Spectrum Next is on Kickstarter and has exceeded its goal of £250,000. The Next costs £175, while a “board-only” version is available for £99. The board-only is expected to ship by August, while the full unit is expected to launch in January 2018.
