A “real-life, playable” Pong table which was posted on Kickstarter has met its funding goal. The Pong “mechanical homage” features the classic paddle game, with a two-player set-up and controls at the opposite ends of a sleek table. The project had a goal of $250,000, and exceeded it with a couple days to spare. Regular backers can still purchase an early-bird special, which consists of the standard Pong table, for $1,100. The images and video below show off the Pong game, which is set to release in December 2017.
