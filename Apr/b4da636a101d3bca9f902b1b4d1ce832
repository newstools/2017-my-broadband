Discovery has launched Vitality Weight Loss Rewards, with the aim of getting members to lose weight. The company stated that the “behaviour-based intervention” will combat the issues of being overweight and obesity. “Vitality Weight Loss Rewards uses behavioural economics principles and methods to help and reward participants – with a Body Mass Index or waist circumference outside recommended ranges – to reach weight-loss goals in short, manageable cycles,” said Discovery.
