SDN Africa has introduced an affordable WAN Optimisation Service based on software from Aritari to address the high level of unmet demand in the SA market. As the first provider of SD-WAN solutions in South Africa, SDN Africa has been successfully representing Aryaka in Sub-Saharan Africa since 2015. Aryaka’s global SD-WAN solution combines a dedicated core network with embedded WAN Optimisation and a software-defined edge (SD Edge) capability. However, the Aryaka solution is architected (and priced) to support global organisations, and is not always a good fit for smaller companies or those with many local sites. Advanced WAN optimisation is the only way to significantly improve cloud application performance but these solutions are usually hardware-based, complicated and expensive. “Many of the emerging SD-WAN edge devices are great for network visibility and bandwidth management, but they don’t support TCP optimisation or any other acceleration technologies like application proxies or data de-duplication,” says Brett Steingo, CEO of SDN Africa Aritari is a provider of SD-WAN, VoIP compression and Data Acceleration software emerging from the evolution and re-branding of UK-based Voipex. “With the combination of Aryaka and Aritari we can help any South African company optimise cloud services and overseas network applications, overcoming the ubiquitous latency challenge experienced by almost every business making use of these global services,” adds Steingo. SDN Africa will be the exclusive distributor of Aritari Accelerate! and SD-WAN for South Africa. “SDN Africa is one of only two companies we know of with actual SD-WAN customers in South Africa,” says Jonathan Nelson, COO of Aritari. “There are several companies advertising SD-WAN solutions, but we wanted to work with an entity with experience running client solutions,” he adds.
