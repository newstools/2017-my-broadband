Apple’s latest plan for the pay-TV market is to sell a premium TV bundle, according to a report by Recode. The report stated that the TV bundle will combine HBO, Showtime, and Starz. If the bundle is approved by the companies involved, it could see Apple selling it as a stand-alone product available on iOS devices and Apple TV. “Apple currently sells HBO for $15 a month, Showtime for $11 a month, and Starz for $9 a month,” stated Recode. Representatives from the networks declined to comment on the reported premium bundle.
