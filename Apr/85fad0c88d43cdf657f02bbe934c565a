The New York International Auto Show takes place from 14 to 23 April at the Javits Centre in New York. The show is a platform for the world’s top car manufacturers to show off their latest models and concepts, and this year’s edition did not disappoint. The event also played host to the 2017 World Car of the Year awards, which saw the Jaguar F-Pace take top honours. A summary of the most epic cars from the event is detailed below. Toyota said the concept vehicle could be powered by a low-displacement engine and would have four-wheel drive.  With 626kW from a 6.2-litre HEMI Demon V8, the Challenger is the most powerful muscle car ever built.  Jeep stated that the Trackhawk is the most powerful and quickest SUV ever built, sporting a 6.2-litre V8 engine which produces 527kW.  The Audi race car features a V10 engine which produces 364kW, which will take the car from 0-100km/h in under 4 seconds.  The police car features a hybrid electric engine and is the first of its kind to be “pursuit-rated”.  The luxury SUV sports a 4.0-litre V8 biturbo engine and promises the ultimate in comfort and performance.  The special edition 370Z will feature a 3.7-litre V6 engine which produces 247kW.  It has snow tracks instead of wheels – enough said.  With just over 1,000kW produced by its 5.0-litre V8 engine, the Agera RS1 will go from 0-300km/h in 12.3 seconds.  The Genesis concept vehicle will be powered by a plug-in fuel cell powertrain and provide “truly refined performance”.
