The Internet Archive can now emulate the early models of the Apple Macintosh – the black-and-white, mouse-driven computer. The company explained that while there were predecessors to the computer desktop paradigm, the introduction of the Macintosh brought it to a mass market. “The first set of emulated Macintosh software is located in this collection. This is a curated presentation of applications, games, and operating systems from 1984 to 1989,” said The Internet Archive. “The story of the creation of the operating system and the Macintosh itself are covered in many collections at the Archive.” “As for the programs currently presented, they are in many cases applications that have survived to the present day in various forms, or are the direct ancestors.” “While it is a 40 megabyte download, this compilation of System 7.0.1 includes a large variety of software programs and a rather rich recreation of the MacOS experience of 1991.”
