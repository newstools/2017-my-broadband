Microsoft announced that Insiders can now register for Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds on their PC using their corporate credentials in Azure Active Directory. “Using corporate credentials will enable you to increase the visibility of your organisation’s feedback – especially on features that support productivity and business needs,” said Microsoft. It said users will also be able to advocate for the needs of their organisation, and have real-time dialogue with Microsoft on features critical to business needs. “This dialogue helps us identify trends in issues organisations are facing when deploying Windows 10 and deliver solutions to you more quickly.” The company said it will roll out more tools aimed at supporting IT professionals and business users in their Insider community.
