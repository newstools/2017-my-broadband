Stellenbosch City Orchestra has cancelled Gameplay, the symphonic video game music concert at The Woodmill in Stellenbosch. Computicket informed ticket holders that they need to return their tickets for refunds no later than 6 May, the day the concert would have been held. “All uncollected tickets and Print@Home transactions have been refunded. Funds will reflect within 3-7 working days,” said Computicket. Conductor Paul van Zuilenburg told MyBroadband that they decided to cancel the show due to a lack of interest. “We sold very few tickets and were going to run into a [R60,000] loss,” said van Zuilenburg. “I desperately still want to do the show and we are negotiating with PACOFS in Bloemfontein for an end of June performance in the Sand du Plessis theatre,” he said. Van Zuilenburg said he is also speaking to Michael James, who heads up rAge in Johannesburg, about having a concert at one of their events.
