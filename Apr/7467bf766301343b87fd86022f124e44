Google’s Verily has unveiled its newest investigational device, the Verily Study Watch, with the ability to passively capture health data. Launched in 2015, Verily is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet (aka Google) focused on life sciences and healthcare. Verily’s mission is to make the world’s health data useful so that people enjoy longer and healthier lives. According to Verily, Study Watch represents another step in its targeted efforts to create new tools for unobtrusive biosensing. Verily Study Watch is designed with these key features: Because the investigational device stores health data, all data are encrypted on the device for security. The encrypted data are uploaded and processed in the cloud using Verily’s backend algorithms and machine learning tools.
