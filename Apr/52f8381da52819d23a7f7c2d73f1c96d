AMD has unveiled its new Radeon RX 500-series graphics cards. The new graphics cards are based on AMD’s Polaris GPU architecture and offer a performance improvement over the Radeon RX 400 series. Radeon RX 500 graphics cards are manufactured on a 14nm process node and feature numerous tweaks and improvements compared to the previous generation of Polaris chips. The new graphics chips boast better power efficiency and higher base clocks, although they are set to be outperformed by AMD’s more expensive Vega graphics cards – coming later this year.
