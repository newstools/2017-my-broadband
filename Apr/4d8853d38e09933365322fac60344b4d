Instagram now allows users to organise their saved posts into private collections. Users can create and name a collection when they save a post, or add it to an existing collection. Users can create multiple collections, allowing for saved posts to be organised into customisable folders. Private collections are accessible under the “Saved Posts” tab in the Instagram app, and are only visible to the creator. 46% of Instagram users have saved at least one post since the introduction of the feature in December 2016.
