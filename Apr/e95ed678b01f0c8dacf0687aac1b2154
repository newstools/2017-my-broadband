Fidelity Investments is the first financial institution to join the Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3), reported Reuters. The group previously consisted of academic institutions and technology companies which want to develop blockchain-based technology. Fidelity Labs, the innovation arm of asset manager Fidelity, will join existing IC3 members – which include IBM, Intel, Cornell University, and University of California at Berkeley. It said it will work with the group to develop blockchain programs to make financial systems more efficient and secure. Blockchains are distributed, open ledgers of transactions that underpin cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
