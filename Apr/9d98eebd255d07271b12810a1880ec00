“Transparency in business” is a phrase that is becoming more and more common under managers, owners, and leaders. “We need more transparency in our business processes”; “There isn’t enough visibility on the ground!” they say. But, what does all of this actually mean? In its most basic form, transparency in business means honesty in the way we operate. It stands for a “lack of hidden agendas or conditions”, the availability of all information needed in order to collaborate, cooperate, and make decisions effectively. Making information available across all functions in real time is central to the objective of achieving transparency in business. However, just having access to this information in isn’t enough. We need to understand what the information means, we have to be able to make sense of it without effort. The best way to do this is by viewing your data through visual representations. The charts and graphs created by business intelligence systems is a good example of this. Moreover, regular updates and reporting creates visibility and drives transparency. For example, a quick report on what the activities of your team looked like today or the past week makes visibility effortless. Honeybee gives you visibility!
